AB's TODO list
==============
libfreeipmi:
------------
[HIGH PRIORITY]
  * Unified Driver Model (one interface for all in-band and out-of-band drivers)

[MEDIUM PRIORITY]
  * Missing IPMI commands.
  * Modify system boot priority table.

[LOW PRIORITY]
  * FRU Commands (SDR Repo does a similar job).
  * Command to Switch MUX between BMC and ttyS1

Al's TODO list
==============
libfreeipmi:
------------
  * IPMI 1.5 Errata - Get Chassis Status 
  * Consider encapsulating length, ids, types in fiid_obj_t
    and fiid_template_t down the road.
  * ipmi_sdr_repo_cache_seek: Add hash/array pointers to avoid
    seeking.  Will probably require a "load and create" wrapper
    function of some sort.
  * Feature to allow atomicity of multiple IPMI commands in a row.
    May or may not be possible.  Think about it.
  * Auto retries in ipmi_lan_cmd()
  * open_lan_session - modify to use best secure connection available
  * Different slave address than BMC as default (i.e. in fill_lan_msg_hdr)
  * Implement md2/md5/hmac/sha1/etc. with gcrypt
  
fish:
-----
  * Create makefile wrappers to allow fish to work locally in
    build directory rather that requiring installation.
  * kcs-raw or something similar in fish
  * wrapper scripts to do proprietary crap
  * don't hang if there is no bmc on the system, die/quit appropriately

bmc-watchdog:
-------------
  * Require Timer use to be SMS/OS?
  * argp

ipmipower:
----------
  * argp
  * Output warning/error/message/something in autoconf if ipmipower
    cannot be compiled with locked pages??
  * There are probably port issues with mmap/mlock.
  * Add readline or similar functionality in interactive mode.
  * Multithread to increase speed even more?
  * statistical monitoring to determine number of power control failures, dup packets, etc.
  * local power off
  * chassis identify
  * rolling windows of power control commands 
  * privilege option - pick user, operator, admin

ipmiping/rmcpping:
------------------
  * argp

General:
--------
  * Testsuite for Freeipmi and IPMI conformance test.
  * New tools?
    - SEL collector/logger thingie for clusters
    - tool/script to detect busted BMC/IORiser
  * config file for KCS port, register spacing, etc.

Autoconf issues:
----------------
  * socklet_t, doesn't exist on all OSes.
  * stdarg.h, other OSes use varargs.h
  * bittypes.h and inttypes.h for u_int32_t, etc.
         
Bala's TODO List:
=================
  * lan based sensors, sel and bmc-info
  * bmc-config --auto-configure
  * sensors will be simplified with Scheme <DONE>
  * dual fiid for ipmi_kcs_lan_set_auth_type_enables

Ian's TODO List:
================
  * Convert fish to the (now preferred) scm_ interface completely.
  * Event Messaging and PEF Subsystem.

Later on:
=========
  * Host monitoring support: Ganglia integration.
  * Additional libfreeipmi examples.
  * Extra documentation on bmc-config
  * Code auditing
    - Templates/API/etc: Some say "username" some have "user_name".
    - Lots of functions don't check input parameters, i.e. null buffers
