libfreeipmi:
------------
* Missing IPMI commands.
  - lan-cmds 
  - msg-support-cmds
  - chassis-cmds
  - serial-cmds
  - sol-cmds
  - pef-cmds
  - sdr-repo-cmds
  - sel-cmds
  - sdr-record-types
  - sel record-types
  - sensor-cmds
* Modify system boot priority table.
* how to support xRC4 (can we? should we?)
* get event messages function that is passed fiids

Autoconf/Portability
--------------------
* socklet_t, doesn't exist on all OSes.
* stdarg.h, other OSes use varargs.h
         
bmc-config:
-----------
Missing Serial Config
Chassis Config?

management:
-----------
move ftp server?
move webpage?

pef-config
--------
* conf.5 manpage
* how to specify event reading type codes

bmc-config/pef-config
-------------------
better parsing/caching for faster commit/checkout
mem-leaks from strdups, is this ever freed?
get functions - too much duplication, can be condensed - need to re-architect in some way
poor use of atoi/strtoul

general
-------
timeout options for most FreeIPMI tools?
ipmi 2.0 for all tools?
sdr caching requires versioning
tool for getting channel information - in ipmi-device tool for 0.5.0?

code cleanup
------------
param->parameter everywyhere 
- after ipmi-chassis committed
<<<<<<< TODO
merge in freeipmi-udm
- after ipmi-chassis, ipmi-fru, and ipmi-pef committed
common stuff for admin priv stuff in tools/manpages
- after ipmi-pef, ipmi-chassis committed
- needed for bmc-config, ipmi-pef, ipmi-chassis
=======
>>>>>>> 1.275
common funcs for udm setup in tools
common funcs for pstdout setup in tools
common funcs for sdr init junk in tools
common stuff for SDR options in manpages
<<<<<<< TODO

rename variables for better consistency?
audit errno/kcs/ssif/openipmi errors -> udm errnos

bugs:

to refactor
ipmi-pef
ipmi-chassis
ipmi-fru
=======
common stuff for parsing in bmc-config and pef-config

re-architecture
---------------
merge in freeipmi-udm
- after ipmi-chassis, ipmi-fru, and pef-config committed
- for 0.4.0 or 0.5.0?
add header comments to fiid.h
