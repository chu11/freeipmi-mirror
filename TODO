AB's TODO list
==============
libfreeipmi:
------------
[HIGH PRIORITY]
  * Unified Driver Model (one interface for all in-band and out-of-band drivers)

[MEDIUM PRIORITY]
  * Missing IPMI commands.
  * Modify system boot priority table.

[LOW PRIORITY]
  * FRU Commands (SDR Repo does a similar job).
  * Command to Switch MUX between BMC and ttyS1

Al's TODO list
==============
libfreeipmi:
------------
  * IPMI 1.5 Errata - Get Chassis Status 
  * Different slave address than BMC as default (i.e. in fill_lan_msg_hdr)
  * Templates must be encapsulated further
  * fiid_obj_t must hold additional info
  * fiid macros - make debugging better, many are useless right now
  * only make those symbols exportable that should be exportable
  * gcrypt: secure mem-buffers
  * gcrypt: thread issues
  * ipmi 2.0 commands
  * gcc 4.0 warnings test/fix
  * password 16 vs 20 bytes fix
    - also see errata
  * sensor-event-messages: get_28_event_data3_messages
  * autoconf pthread finding

fish:
-----
  * Create makefile wrappers to allow fish to work locally in
    build directory rather that requiring installation.

ipmipower
---------
  * compile options to make workarounds automatic for ipmipower

General:
--------
  * sel aggregator

Autoconf/Portability
--------------------
  * socklet_t, doesn't exist on all OSes.
  * stdarg.h, other OSes use varargs.h
  * bittypes.h and inttypes.h for u_int32_t, etc.
         
Bala's TODO List:
=================
  * lan based sensors, sel and bmc-info
  * bmc-config --auto-configure
  * sensors will be simplified with Scheme <DONE>
  * dual fiid for ipmi_kcs_lan_set_auth_type_enables

Ian's TODO List:
================
  * Convert fish to the (now preferred) scm_ interface completely.
  * Event Messaging and PEF Subsystem.

Later on:
=========
  * Host monitoring support: Ganglia integration.
  * Additional libfreeipmi examples.
  * Code auditing
    - Templates/API/etc: Some say "username" some have "user_name".
    - Lots of functions don't check input parameters, i.e. null buffers
