.SH "NAME"
ipmiconsole \- IPMI console utility
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.B ipmiconsole
[\fIOPTION\fR...]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.B ipmiconsole
is a Serial-over-LAN (SOL) console utility.  It can be used to establish
console sessions to remote machines using the IPMI 2.0 SOL protocol.

.SH "IPMI 2.0 SOL"
.B Ipmiconsole 
communicates with a remote machine's Baseboard Management Controller
(BMC) to establish a console session.  Before any SOL communication
can take place, the remote machine's BMC must be configured properly.
Of primary importance, the IP address, MAC address, subnet, usernames,
passwords, privileges, SOL availability, SOL privilege, and SOL user
access must be configured and enabled.  The FreeIPMI tool
.B bmc-config(1) 
may be used to do this configuration.  A BMC configuration tool may
have also been distributed with the machine.
.LP
Often (although not always), console redirection must be also 
be configured properly in the BIOS and/or operating system.  Both must
be configured to redirect console traffic out the appropriate COM port.

.TP
\fB\-u\fR, \fB\-\-username\fR=\fIUSERNAME\fR
Specify the username to use when authenticating with the remote host.
If not specified, a null (i.e. anonymous) username is assumed.  The
user must a high enough privilege to establish a SOL session and have
SOL session abilities.

.TP
\fB\-\-session-timeout\fR=\fIMILLISECONDS\fR
Specify the session timeout in milliseconds.  Defaults to 60000
milliseconds (60 seconds) if not specified.
.TP
\fB\-\-retransmission-timeout\fR=\fIMILLISECONDS\fR
Specify the packet retransmission timeout in milliseconds.  Defaults
to 500 milliseconds (0.5 seconds) if not specified.
.TP
\fB\-I\fR, \fB\-\-cipher\-suite-id\fR=\fICIPHER-SUITE-ID\fR
Specify the IPMI 2.0 cipher suite ID to use. The Cipher Suite ID
identifies a set of authentication, integrity, and confidentiality
algorithms to use for IPMI 2.0 communication. The authentication
algorithm identifies the algorithm to use for session setup, the
integrity algorithm identifies the algorithm to use for session packet
signatures, and the confidentiality algorithm identifies the algorithm
to use for payload encryption. Defaults to cipher suite ID 3 if not
specified.  The user should be aware that only cipher suite ids 3, 8,
and 12 encrypt console payloads.  Console information will be sent in
the clear an alternate cipher suite id is selected.  The following
cipher suite ids are currently supported:
.sp
0 - Authentication Algorithm = None; Integrity Algorithm = None; Confidentiality Algorithm = None
.sp
1 - Authentication Algorithm = HMAC-SHA1; Integrity Algorithm = None; Confidentiality Algorithm = None
.sp

Output debugging to the debugfile rather than to standard output.

Don't enter terminal raw mode.

.SH "IPMICONSOLE OPTIONS"
The following options are specific to
.B Ipmiconsole.
.TP
\fB\-e\fR, \fB\-\-escape-char\fR
Specify an alternate escape character (default char '&').
.TP
\fB\-N\fR, \fB\-\-dont-steal\fR
Do not steal an SOL session if one is already detected as being in
use.  Under most circumstances, if SOL is detected as being in use,
.B ipmiconsole
will attempt to steal the SOL session away from the previous session.
This default behavior exists for several reasons, most notably that
earlier SOL sessions may have not been able to be deactivate properly.
.TP
\fB\-T\fR, \fB\-\-deactivate\fR
Deactivate a SOL session if one is detected as being in use and exit.
.TP
\fB\-L\fR, \fB\-\-lock-memory\fR
Lock sensitive information (such as usernames and passwords) in
memory.
.TP
\fB\-C\fR, \fB\-\-config file\fR=\fIFILE\fR
Specify an alternate configuration file.
.LP

.SH "ESCAPE CHARACTERS"
The following escape sequences are supported.  The default supported
escape character is '&', but can be changed with the 
\fB\-e\fR
option.
.TP
.I &?
Display a list of currently available escape sequences.
.TP
.I &.
Terminate the connection.
.TP
.I &B
Send a "serial-break" to the remote console.
.TP
.I &D
Send a DEL character.
.TP
.I &&
Send a single escape character.

.SH "IPMICONSOLE TROUBLESHOOTING"
The following are common issues for given error messages specifically
for 
.B ipmiconsole.
.LP
"SOL unavailable" - SOL is not configured for use on the remote BMC.
It may be not configured in general or for the specific user
specified.  Authenticating with a different user may be sufficient,
however the IPMI protocol does not reveal detail on what is not
configured on the remote BMC.
.LP
"SOL in use" - SOL is already in use on the remote BMC.  If you do not
specify the
.I --dont-steal
option, 
.B ipmiconsole
will attempt to steal the SOL session away from the other session.
.LP
"SOL session stolen" - Your SOL session has been stolen by another
session.  You may wish to try and steal the session back by reconnecting.
.LP
"SOL requires encryption" - SOL requires a cipher suite id that
includes encryption.  Please try to use cipher suite id 3, 8, or 12.
It may also be possible the encryption requirements are not configured
correctly on the remote BMC.
.LP
"SOL requires no encryption" - SOL requires a cipher suite id that
does not use encryption.  Please try to use cipher suite id 0, 1, 2,
6, 7, or 11.  It may also be possible the encryption requirements are
not configured correctly on the remote BMC.
.LP
"BMC Implementation" - The BMC on the remote machine has a severe
problem in its implementation.  Please see the WORKAROUNDS section
below for possible workarounds.  If additional vendor workarounds are
required, please contact the authors.
.LP
"excess retransmissions sent" - An excessive number of retransmissions
of SOL packets has occurred and 
.B ipmiconsole
has given up.  This may be due to network issues or SOL issues.  Some
of the same issues involved with "connection timeout" or "session
timeout" errors may be involved.  Please try to reconnect.
.LP
"excess errors received" - An excessive number of SOL packet errors
has occurred and 
.B ipmiconsole
has given up.  This may be due to network issues or SOL issues.
Please try to reconnect.

.if @WITH_DEBUG@ \{

This version of ipmiconsole was compiled with debugging.  When compiled
with debugging,
.B ipmiconsole 
is insecure.  The following were intentionally
left in
.B ipmiconsole
for debugging purposes:

.IP o 2
Sensitive command line arguments are not cleared from memory.
.IP o
Core dumps are enabled.

Before placing ipmiconsole in a production system, it is recommended
that the program be compiled with debugging turned off.
