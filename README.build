Building/Install from source
----------------------------

The instructions below (modified from the INSTALL file) should
work for most people.

  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
     `./configure' to configure the package for your system.

     Running `configure' takes awhile.  While running, it prints some
     messages telling which features it is checking for.  If your system
     requires additional packages and/or libraries in order for FreeIPMI
     to be built, appropriate messages should be displayed.  These
     packages and/or libraries should be installed and `./configure' should
     be executed again.

  2. Once `./configure' has succeeded, type `make' to compile the
     package.

  3. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
     documentation.

     You may need to be root in order for files to be installed into
     the proper locations on your system.

By default files will typically be installed in /usr/local (binaries
in /usr/local/bin, libraries in /usr/local/lib, configuration files in
/usr/local/etc/, etc.).  To install into the more common locations
such as /usr/bin, /usr/lib/, /etc, etc. the options passed into
`./configure' must be adjusted.

The following set of options and settings are suitable for most Linux
systems.

--prefix=/usr --exec-prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc
--localstatedir=/var --mandir=/usr/share/man

Your mileage may vary depending on your system.

If you install the binaries or libraries in non-standard locations
(e.g. /usr/local or /opt), you may have to update other system
configuration to find the files and libraries.  For example, in Linux
you may need to update your PATH or LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment
variables.  Or you may need to update your /etc/ld.so.conf files and
run ldconfig(8) to find libraries globally.  This is highly dependent
on your operating system.

Building RPMs
-------------

For most people you can build RPMs one of two ways.

From the source:

rpmbuild -ta freeipmi-X.Y.Z.tar.gz

From the source rpm:

rpmbuild --rebuild freeipmi-X.Y.Z-1.src.rpm

Depending on your default RPM build environment, you may need to be root
in order for RPMs to be stored in the default locations.

After the RPMs are built, you may install them the normal way:

rpm -i freeipmi-X.Y.Z.ARCH.rpm

Additional configure options
----------------------------

The following configure options are available to users for more unique
compilation requirements and environments.

--without-encryption

This option disables compilation of encryption support in FreeIPMI.
Most notably, this disables encryption support when doing out of band
IPMI 2.0 communication.

This option may be particularly useful in embedded environments that
do not have the libraries needed to compile encryption support.

--with-dont-check-for-root

When running tools inband, root access is normally required.  In some
systems, this may not be desired.  This options removes the check for
root access in FreeIPMI tools.

--without-random-device

This option disables checks and use of /dev/urandom and /dev/random.
This may be required for embedded systems without these devices.

--with-pkgconfig-dir

This option can configure an alternate default pkgconfig directory.

--with-bmc-watchdog-logfile

This option can configure an alternate default bmc-watchdog log
directory.

--with-ipmi-monitoring-sdr-cache-dir

This option can configure an alternate default libipmimonitoring SDR
cache directory.
