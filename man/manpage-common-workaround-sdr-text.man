\fIassumemaxsdrrecordcount\fR - This workaround will inform SDR
reading to stop reading after a known maximum number of SDR records
have been read.  This will work around systems that have
miss-implemented SDR reading functions.  Those hitting this issue may
see "SDR record count invalid" errors.  Issue observed on unspecified
Inspur motherboard.
