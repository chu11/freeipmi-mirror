.SH "NAME"
FreeIPMI - FreeIPMI overview
.SH "Introduction"
FreeIPMI provides in-band and out-of-band IPMI software based on the
IPMI v1.5/2.0 specification.
.SH "What is IPMI?"
The IPMI specification defines a set of interfaces for platform
management and is implemented by a number vendors for system
management.  The features of IPMI that most users will be interested
in are sensor monitoring, system event monitoring, power control, and
serial-over-LAN (SOL).  The FreeIPMI tools and libraries listed below
should provide users with the ability to access and utilize these
and many other features of IPMI.
.PP
.SH "Getting Started with IPMI"
IPMI can be used in-band (i.e. running on a machine locally) or
out-of-band (i.e. connecting remotely).
.PP
Most FreeIPMI tools can operate in-band by using one of the in-band
drivers included.  These in-band drivers include a userspace KCS
interface driver, a SSIF driver through the Linux SSIF device
(i.e. /dev/i2c-0), the OpenIPMI Linux kernel driver (i.e. /dev/ipmi0),
the Sun/Solaris BMC driver (i.e. /dev/bmc), and the Intel DCMI/MEI
driver (i.e. /dev/dcmi).  If your system requires the use of installed
drivers, those appropriate modules must be installed ahead of time.
However, most systems should automatically load these drivers when
appropriate.
.PP
Under most scenarios, the FreeIPMI tools should automatically discover
which in-band interface to use and the proper settings to use.  Users
may execute the tools on the command line to begin using them.  Some
motherboards may require you to determine driver type, addresses,
paths, etc. on your own and pass them as command line options to the
tools.  You may use
.B ipmi-locate(8) 
to help determine
this information.  Other tools such as 
.B dmidecode(8)
may also provide
this information.
.PP
To use IPMI out-of-band with tools such as 
.B ipmipower(8) 
or
.B ipmi-sensors(8), 
the remote machine's BMC must first be configured for out of band
communication.  Typically, this involves setting a username, password,
IP address, MAC address, and a few other parameters.  This can be done
using the tool
.B ipmi-config(8).  
Additional information on how to configure with
.B ipmi-config(8) 
can be found
in the
.B ipmi-config.conf(5) 
manpage.  Some vendors may pre-configure their motherboards with
default values so that 
.B ipmi-config(8)
can be used remotely to configure the machine.  However, most of the
time, the BMC must be configured in-band before out-of-band access can
be allowed (for example, the correct IP address and MAC address must
be configured).

.PP
In order to remotely connect to a machine, you typically must specify
the host, username, and password for the tool in order to connect.
Depending on configuration settings, a K_g key, privilege level,
authentication type, cipher suite id, or protocol version may need to
be specified.

.PP
Some vendors may have not implemented IPMI properly and a workaround
must be specified into FreeIPMI to ensure the tool can execute
properly.  For example, a fair number of vendors have populated their
FRU records with invalid checksums.  To properly ignore these set of
checksums a \fIskipchecks\fR workaround has been added to
.B ipmi-fru(8).
Please see each of the tool manpages to see a list of available
workarounds.

.PP
Additional information, examples, and general trouble-shooting can be
found in each of the tool manpages.

.SH "General Use"
The primary tools that most users of FreeIPMI will be interested in
for system management are the following:
.PP
.B Ipmi-sensors
.PP
A tool to read IPMI sensor readings to aid in system monitoring.
.PP
.B Ipmi-sel
.PP
A tool to read and manage IPMI System Event Log (SEL) records to aid
in system debugging.
.PP
.B Ipmipower
.PP
A tool for remote power control.
.PP
.B Ipmiconsole
.PP
A tool for Serial-over-Lan (SOL) console access.
.PP
Many other tools and libraries are listed below that cover additional
features and areas of IPMI.
.PP
Additional information, examples, and general trouble-shooting can be
found in each of the tool manpages.

.SH "Configuration"
In order to avoid typing in a long list of command line options to
specify IPMI communication requirements everytime a command is
executed (e.g. driver paths, usernames, passwords, etc.), an
alternate set of default values can be set for most FreeIPMI
tools in the FreeIPMI configuration file.  See 
.B freeipmi.conf(5)
for more information.

.SH "HPC Support"
Much of FreeIPMI was written with HPC support in mind.  
.B Ipmi-config(8)
comes with file input/output support so that configuration can be
copied and verified across nodes in a cluster.  Most tools (like
.B ipmipower(8) 
and 
.B ipmi-sensors(8)
) come with hostrange support so multiple hosts can be specified on
the command line at the same time and IPMI can be executed against
the hosts in parallel.  See tool manpages for more information.
Also see the document 
\fIfreeipmi-hostrange.txt\fR 
for detailed usage and explanation.
.B Ipmi-sensors(8)
and the
.B libipmimonitoring(3)
library support the ability to interpret sensor readings as well as
just reporting them.  By mapping sensor readings into NOMINAL,
WARNING, or CRITICAL states, it makes monitoring sensors easier across
large numbers of nodes.

.SH "Development"
