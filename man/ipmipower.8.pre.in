.SH "NAME"
ipmipower \- IPMI power control utility
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.B ipmipower
[\fIOPTION\fR...]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.B Ipmipower
allows users to remotely power on, off, cycle, hard reset, get a power
status query, perform a pulse diagnostic interrupt, or initiate a
soft-shutdown of the OS via ACPI through the IPMI over LAN protocol.
.LP
When a power command (\fB\-\-on\fR, \fB\-\-off\fR, \fB\-\-cycle\fR,
\fB\-\-reset\fR, \fB\-\-stat\fR, \fB\-\-pulse\fR, or \fB\-\-soft\fR)
is specified on the command line,
.B Ipmipower
will attempt to run the power command on all hostnames listed on the
command line then exit.
.LP
If no power commands are specified on the command line,
.B ipmipower
will run in interactive mode.  Interactive mode gives the user a
command line interface to enter various commands.  Details of the
interactive command line interface can be found below under
INTERACTIVE COMMANDS.

.SH "IPMIPOWER OPTIONS"
The following options are specific to
.B ipmipower.
.TP
\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-on\fR
Power on the target hosts.
.TP
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-off\fR
Power off the target hosts.
.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-cycle\fR
Power cycle the target hosts.
.TP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-reset\fR
Reset the target hosts.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-stat\fR
Get power status of the target hosts.
.TP
\fB\-\-pulse\fR
Send power diagnostic interrupt to target hosts.
.TP
\fB\-\-soft\fR
Initiate a soft-shutdown of the OS via ACPI.
.TP
\fB\-\-on\-if\-off\fR
The IPMI specification does not require the power cycle or hard reset
commands to turn on a machine that is currently powered off.  This
option will force
.B ipmipower
to issue a power on command instead of a power cycle or hard reset
command if the remote machine's power is currently off.
.TP
\fB\-\-wait\-until\-on\fR
The IPMI specification allows power on commands to return prior to the
power on actually taking place.  This option will force
.B ipmipower
to regularly query the remote BMC and return only after the machine
has powered on.
.TP
\fB\-\-wait\-until\-off\fR
The IPMI specification allows power off commands to return prior the
power off actually taking place.  This option will force
.B ipmipower
to regularly query the remote BMC and return only after the machine
has powered off.
.TP
\fB\-\-oem\-power\-type\fR=\fIOEM\-POWER\-TYPE\fR
This option informs
.B ipmipower
to initiate power control operations via an IPMI OEM specific power
control extension.  The currently available POWERTYPEs are \fINONE\fR
and \fIC410X\fR.  Please see OEM POWER EXTENSIONS below for additional
information.

.SH "IPMIPOWER ADVANCED NETWORK OPTIONS"
The following options are used to change the networking behavior of
.B ipmipower.
.TP
\fB\-\-retransmission\-wait\-timeout\fR=\fIMILLISECONDS\fR
Specify the retransmission wait timeout length in milliseconds.  The
retransmission wait timeout is similar to the retransmission timeout
above, but is used specifically for power completion verification with
the \fB\-\-wait\-until\-on\fR and \fB\-\-wait\-until\-off\fR options.
Defaults to 500 milliseconds (0.5 seconds).
.TP
\fB\-\-retransmission\-backoff\-count\fR=\fICOUNT\fR
Specify the retransmission backoff count for retransmissions.  After
ever COUNT retransmissions, the retransmission timeout length will be
increased by another factor.  Defaults to 8.
.TP
\fB\-\-ping\-interval\fR=\fIMILLISECONDS\fR
Specify the ping interval length in milliseconds.  When running in
interactive mode, RMCP (Remote Management Control Protocol) discovery
messages will be sent to all configured remote hosts every
MILLISECONDS to confirm their support of IPMI.  Power commands cannot
be sent to a host until it is discovered (or re-discovered if
previously lost).  Defaults to 5000 milliseconds (5 seconds).  Ping
discovery messages can be disabled by setting this value to 0.  RMCP
ping discovery messages are automatically disabled in non-interactive
mode.
.TP
\fB\-\-ping\-timeout\fR=\fIMILLISECONDS\fR
Specify the ping timeout length in milliseconds.  When running in
interactive mode, RMCP (Remote Management Control Protocol) messages
discovery will be sent to all configured remote hosts to confirm their
support of IPMI. A remote host is considered undiscovered if the host
does not respond in MILLISECONDS time.  Defaults to 30000 milliseconds
(30 seconds).  The ping timeout cannot be larger than the ping interval.
.TP
\fB\-\-ping\-packet\-count\fR=\fICOUNT\fR
Specify the ping packet count size.  Defaults to 10.  See the
\fB\-\-ping-percent\-fR option below for more information on this
option.
.TP
\fB\-\-ping\-percent\fR=\fIPERCENT\fR
Specify the ping percent value.  Defaults to 50.

Since IPMI is based on UDP, it is
difficult for
.B ipmipower
to distinguish between a missing machine and a bad (or heavily loaded)
network connection in interactive mode.  when running in interactive
mode.  For example, suppose a link consistently drops 80% of the
packets to a particular machine.  The power control operation may have
difficulty completing, although a recent pong response from RMCP makes
.B ipmipower
believe the machine is up and functioning properly.

The ping packet count and percent options are used to alleviate this
problem.
.B Ipmipower
will monitor RMCP ping packets in packet count chunks.  If
.B ipmipower
does not receive a response to greater than ping percent of those
packets,
.B ipmipower
will assume the link to this node is bad and will not send power
control operations to that node until the connection is determined to
be reliable.  This heuristic can be disabled by setting either the
ping packet count or ping percent to 0.  This feature is not used if
ping interval is set to 0.
.TP
\fB\-\-ping\-consec\-count\fR=\fICOUNT\fR
Specify the ping consecutive count.  This is another heuristic used to
determine if a node should be considered discovered, undiscovered, or
with a bad connection.  If a valid RMCP pong response was received for
the last COUNT ping packets, a node will be considered discovered,
regardless of other heuristics listed above.  Defaults to 5.  This
heuristic can be disabled by setting this value to 0.  This feature is
not used if other ping features described above are disabled.

.SH "OEM POWER EXTENSIONS"
Some motherboards include IPMI OEM extensions for alternate power
control mechanisms.  For example, these power control mechanisms may
allow you to power control a sub-device within the system rather than
the entire system itself.
.LP
By specifying an OEM power type via \fB\-\-oem\-power\-type\fR on the
command line or
.B freeipmi.conf(5),
you can instruct
.B ipmipower
to execute alternate power control implementations over the standard
ones.  Depending on the OEM extension, some power control commands may
no longer be available.  For example, an OEM
extension may allow
\fBon\fR but not \fBcycle\fR.  Specific
.B ipmipower
options may not longer function either.
.LP
Some OEM extensions may require additional arguments for their power
control action, such as a sub-device identifier.  Additional arguments
can be provided by appending a plus sign ('+') and the extra
information to the end of the hostname.  This can be done on the
command line or in interactive mode.  For example, the hostname
\fImynode+18\fR would indicate the power control operation should be
sent to the host \fImynode\fR, and \fI18\fR is the identifier of a
possible sub-device to be power controlled.  The
\fI\-\-consolidate\-output\fR option is commonly disabled when using
an OEM power control that requires extra arguments.

.LP
Because OEM power control may involve subtypes, it is possible a user
may wish to power control multiple sub-devices on the same host.  For
example, you might specify the hosts \fImynode+1,mynode+2\fR,
indicating to power control subdevice 1 and 2 on \fImynode\fR.
Because many BMCs cannot handle multiple IPMI sessions, power control
operations to the same host will be serialized internally by
.B ipmipower.
.LP
The following are the current OEM power types available, along with
information on the systems they work with and the power control
operations available.
.TP
.B C410X
This OEM power type supports the power control of PCIe slots on Dell
Poweredge C410x systems.  It supports \fBon\fR, \fBoff\fR, and
\fBstat\fR.  The PCIe slot number ranges from 1-16 and must always be
specified when attempting to power control with this extension.  For
example, the hostname \fImynode+2\fR would inform
.B ipmipower
to operate on slot number \fI2\fR on \fImynode\fR.
The C410x appears to have difficulty handling new slot power control
requests until prior ones have completed.  Users may wish to strongly
consider using the \fB\-\-wait\-until\-on\fR and
\fB\-\-wait\-until\-off\fR options if multiple slots will be power
controlled in short succession.

.TP
.B NONE
This informs
.B ipmipower
that no OEM power type extension is to be used and standard IPMI power
control is used.  This is the default.

#include <@top_srcdir@/man/manpage-common-hostranged-text-main.man>
.LP
When multiple hosts are specified by the user, a socket will be
created for each host and polled on, effectively allowing
communication to all hosts in parallel.  This will allow communication
to large numbers of nodes far more quickly than if done in serial.
The \fB\-F\fR option can configure the number of nodes that can be
communicated with in parallel at the same time.
#include <@top_srcdir@/man/manpage-common-hostranged-text-options.man>
.SH "EXAMPLES"

.SH "IPMIPOWER TROUBLESHOOTING"
When powering on a powered off machine, the client must have a means
by which to resolve the MAC address of the remote machine's ethernet
card.  While most modern IPMI solutions support the ability to ARP and
resolve addresses when the machine is powered off, some older machines
do not.  This is typically solved in one of two ways:
.LP
1) Enable gratuitous ARPs on the remote machine.  The remote machine
will send out a gratuitous ARP, which advertises the ethernet IP and
MAC address so that other machines on the network this information
their local ARP cache.  For large clusters, this method is not
recommended since gratuitous ARPs can flood the network with
unnecessary traffic.
.LP
2) Permanently store the remote machine's MAC address in the local ARP
cache.  This is the more common approach on large clusters.
.LP
Other methods are listed in the IPMI specification.

#include <@top_srcdir@/man/manpage-common-workaround-outofband-20-text.man>
.LP
\fIipmiping\fR - This workaround option will inform
.B ipmipower
to use IPMI based ping packets instead of RMCP ping packets.  Some
motherboards have been observed to not implement RMCP ping/pong
support despite being required by the IPMI specification.  Issue
observed on Intel Windmill, Quanta Winterfell, and Wiwynn Windmill.

#include <@top_srcdir@/man/manpage-common-diagnostics-hostranged-text.man>
.LP
When operating in interactive mode, the exit value will be based on the last
power operation executed.

#include <@top_srcdir@/man/manpage-common-known-issues.man>
.LP
IPMI specifications do not require BMCs to perform a power control
operation before returning a completion code to the caller.
Therefore, it is possible for
.B ipmipower
to return power status queries opposite of what you are expecting.
For example, if a "power off" operation is performed, a BMC may return
a successful completion code to
.B ipmipower
before the "power off" operation is actually performed.  Subsequent
power status queries may return "on" for several seconds, until the
BMC actually performs the "power off" operation.
.LP
.if @WITH_DEBUG@ \{
