ipmi-config \- IPMI configuration file details
.br
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Before many IPMI tools can be used over a network, a machine's
Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) must be configured.  The
configuration can be quite daunting for those who do not know much
about IPMI.  This manpage hopes to provide enough information on BMC
configuration so that you can configure the BMC for your system.  When
appropriate, typical BMC configurations will be suggested.
.LP
The following is an example configuration file partially generated
by running the \fI\-\-checkout\fR option with the
.B ipmi-config(8)
command.  This configuration comes from the \fIcore\fR category of
configuration values (the default).  This example configuration should
be sufficient for most users after the appropriate local IP and MAC
addresses are input.  Following this example, separate sections of
this manpage will discuss the different sections of the configuration
file in more detail with explanations of how the BMC can be configured
for different environments.
.LP
Note that many options may or may not be available on your particular
machine.  For example, Serial-Over-Lan (SOL) is available only on IPMI
2.0 machines.  Therefore, if you are looking to configure an IPMI 1.5
machine, many of the SOL or IPMI 2.0 related options will be be
unavailable to you.  The number of configurable users may also vary
for your particular machine.
.LP
The below configuration file and most of this manpage assume the user
is interested in configuring a BMC for use with IPMI over LAN.
Various configuration options from 
.B ipmi-config(8)
have been left out or skipped because it is considered unnecessary.
Future versions of this manpage will try to include more information.

.SH "Section User1, User2, ..."
The \fIUser\fR sections of the BMC configuration file are for username
configuration for IPMI over LAN communication.  The number of users
available to be configured on your system will vary by manufacturer.
With the exception of the Username for User1, all sections are
identical.
.LP
The username(s) you wish to configure the BMC with are defined with
\fIUsername\fR.  The first username under Section User1 is typically
the NULL username and cannot be modified.  The password for the
username can be specified with \fIPassword\fR.  It can be left empty
to define a NULL password.  Each user you wish to enable must be
enabled through the \fIEnable_User\fR configuration option.  It is
recommended that all usernames have non-NULL passwords or be disabled
for security reasons.
.LP
\fILan_Enable_Ipmi_Msgs\fR is used to enable or disable IPMI over LAN
access for the user.  This should be set to "Yes" to allow
IPMI over LAN tools to work.
.LP
\fILan_Privilege_Limit\fR specifies the maximum privilege level limit
the user is allowed.  Different IPMI commands have different privilege
restrictions.  For example, determining the power status of a machine
only requires the "User" privilege level.  However, power cycling
requires the "Operator" privilege.  Typically, you will want to assign
atleast one user with a privilege limit of "Administrator" so that all
system functions are available to atleast one user via IPMI over LAN.
.LP
\fILan_Session_Limit\fR specifies the number of simultaneous IPMI
sessions allowed for the user.  Most users will wish to set this to
"0" to allow unlimited simultaneous IPMI sessions.  This field is
considered optional by IPMI standards, and may result in errors when
attempting to configure it to a non-zero value.  If errors to occur,
setting the value back to 0 should resolve problems.
.LP
\fISOL_Payload_Access\fR specifies if a particular user is allowed to
connect with Serial-Over-LAN (SOL).  This should be set to "Yes"
to allow this username to use SOL.
.LP
The example configuration above disables "User2" but enables the
default "NULL" (i.e. anonymous) user.  Many IPMI tools (both
open-source and vendor) do not allow the user to input a username and
assume the NULL username by default.  If the tools you are interested
in using allow usernames to be input, then it is recommended that one
of the non-NULL usernames be enabled and the NULL username disabled
for security reasons.  It is recommeneded that you disable the NULL
username in section User1, so that users are required to specify a
username for IPMI over LAN communication.
.LP
Some motherboards may require a \fIUsername\fR to be configured prior
to other fields being read/written.  If this is the case, those fields
will be set to \fI<username-not-set-yet>\fR.

.SH "Section Lan_Channel"
The Lan_Channel section configures a variety of IPMI over LAN
configuration parameters.  Both \fIVolatile\fR and \fINon_Volatile\fR
configurations can be set.  \fIVolatile\fR configurations are
immediately configured onto the BMC and will have immediate effect on
the system.  \fINon_Volatile\fR configurations are only available
after the next system reset.  Generally, both the \fIVolatile\fR and
\fINon_Volatile\fR should be configured identically.
.LP
The \fIAccess_Mode\fR parameter configures the availability of IPMI
over LAN on the system.  Typically this should be set to
"Always_Available" to enable IPMI over LAN.
.LP
The \fIPrivilege_Limit\fR sets the maximum privilege any user of the
system can have when performing IPMI over LAN.  This should be set to
the maximum privilege level configured to a username.  Typically, this
should be set to "Administrator".
.LP
Typically \fIUser_Level_Auth\fR and \fIPer_Message_Auth\fR should be
set to "Yes" for additional security. Disabling \fIUser_Level_Auth\fR
allows "User" privileged IPMI commands to be executed without
authentication.  Disabling \fIPer_Message_Auth\fR allows fewer
individual IPMI messages to require authentication.

.SH "Section Lan_Conf"
Those familiar with setting up networks should find most of the fields
in this section self explanatory.  The example BMC configuration above
illustrates the setup of a static IP address.  The field
\fIIP_Address_Source\fR is configured with "Static".  The IP address,
subnet mask, and gateway IP addresses of the machine are respecitvely
configured with the \fIIP_Address\fR, \fISubnet_Mask\fR,
\fIDefault_Gateway_Ip_Address\fR, and \fIBackup_Gateway_Ip_Address\fR
fields.  The respective MAC addresses for the IP addresses are
configured under \fIMac_Address\fR, \fIDefault_Gateway_Mac_Address\fR,
and \fIBackup_Gateway_Mac_Address\fR.
.LP
It is not required to setup the BMC \fIIP_Address\fR to be the same
\fIP_Address\fR used by your operating system for that network
interface.  However, if you choose to use a different address, an
alternate ARP configuration may need to be setup.
.LP
To instead setup your BMC network information via DHCP, the field
\fIIP_Address_Source\fR should be configured with "Use_DHCP".
.LP
It is recommended that static IP addresses be configured for address
resolution reasons.  See 
.B Lan_Conf_Misc 
below for a more detailed explanation.

.SH "Section Lan_Conf_Auth" 
This section determines what types of password authentication
mechanisms are allowed for users at different privilege levels under
the IPMI 1.5 protocol.  The currently supported authentication methods
for IPMI 1.5 are \fINone\fR (no username/password required),
\fIStraight_Password\fR (passwords are sent in the clear), \fIMD2\fR
(passwords are MD2 hashed), and \fIMD5\fR (passwords are MD5 hashed).
Different usernames at different privilege levels may be allowed to
authenticate differently through this configuration.  For example, a
username with "User" privileges may be allowed to authenticate with a
straight password, but a username with "Administrator" privileges may
be allowed only authenticate with MD5.
.LP
The above example configuration supports \fIMD2\fR and \fIMD5\fR
authentication for all users at the "User", "Operator", and
"Administrator" privilege levels.  All authentication mechanisms have
been disabled for the "Callback" privilege level.
.LP
Generally speaking, you do not want to allow any user to authenticate
with \fINone\fR or \fIStraight_Password\fR for security reasons.
\fIMD2\fR and \fIMD5\fR are digital signature algorithms that can
minimally encrypt passwords.  If you have chosen to support the NULL
username (enabled User1) and NULL passwords (NULL password for User1),
you will have to enable the \fINone\fR authentication fields above to
allow users to connect via \fINone\fR.

.SH "Section Lan_Conf_Security_Keys"
This section supports configuration of the IPMI 2.0 (including
Serial-over-LAN) K_g key.  If your machine does not support IPMI 2.0,
this field will not be configurable.
.LP
The key is used for two-key authentication in IPMI 2.0.  In most
tools, when doing IPMI 2.0, the K_g can be optionally specified.  It
is not required for IPMI 2.0 operation.
.LP
In the above example, we have elected to leave this field blank so the
K_g key is not used.

.SH "Section Lan_Conf_Misc"
This section lists miscellaneous IPMI over LAN configuration options.
These are optional IPMI configuration options that are not
implemented on all BMCs.
.LP
Normally, a client cannot resolve the ethernet MAC address without the
remote operating system running.  However, IPMI over LAN would not
work when a machine is powered off or if the IP address used by the
operating system for that network interface differs from the BMC IP
Address.  One way to work around this is through gratuitous ARPs.
Gratuitous ARPs are ARP packets generated by the BMC and sent out to
advertise the BMC's IP and MAC address.  Other machines on the network
can store this information in their local ARP cache for later
IP/hostname resolution.  This would allow IPMI over LAN to work when
the remote machine is powered off.  The \fIEnable_Gratuitous_Arps\fR
option allows you to enable or disable this feature.  The
\fIGratuitous_Arp_Interval\fR option allows you to configure the
frequency at which gratuitous ARPs are sent onto the network.
.LP
Instead of gratuitous ARPs some BMCs are able to respond to ARP
requests, even when powered off.  If offerred, this feature can be
enabled through the \fIEnable_Arp_Response\fR option.
.LP
Generally speaking, turning on gratuitous ARPs is acceptable.  
However, it will increase traffic on your network.  
If you are using IPMI on a large cluster, the gratuitous ARPs
may easily flood your network.  They should be tuned to occur less
frequently or disabled.  If disabled, the remote machine's MAC address
should be permanently stored in the local ARP cache through 
.B arp(8).
.LP
See
.B bmc-watchdog(8)
for a method which allows gratuitous ARPs to be disabled when the
operating system is running, but enabled when the system is down.

.SH "Section Rmcpplus_Conf_Privilege"
This section supports configuration of the IPMI 2.0 (including
Serial-over-LAN) cipher suite IDs.  If your machine does not support
IPMI 2.0, the fields will not be configurable.
.LP
Each cipher suite ID describes a combination of an authentication
algorithm, integrity algorithm, and encryption algorithm for IPMI 2.0.
The authentication algorithm is used for user authentication with the
BMC.  The integrity algorithm is used for generating signatures on
IPMI packets.  The confidentiality algorithm is used for encrypting
data.  The configuration in this section enables certain cipher suite
IDs to be enabled or disabled, and the maximum privilege level a
username can authenticate with.
.LP
The following table shows the cipher suite ID to algorithms mapping:
.LP

.LP
Generally speaking, HMAC-SHA1 based algorithms are stronger than
HMAC-MD5, which are better than MD5-128 algorithms.  AES-CBC-128
confidentiality algorithms are stronger than xRC4-128 algorithms,
which are better than xRC4-40 algorithms.  Cipher suite ID 3 is
therefore typically considered the most secure.  Some users may wish
to set cipher suite ID 3 to a privilege level and disable all 
remaining cipher suite IDs.
.LP
The above example configuration has decided to allow any user with
"Administrator" privileges use any Cipher Suite algorithm suite which
requires an authentication, integrity, and confidentiality algorithm.
Typically, the maximum privilege level configured to a username should
be set for atleast one cipher suite ID.  Typically, this is the
"Administrator" privilege.
.LP
A number of cipher suite IDs are optionally implemented, so the 
available cipher suite IDs available your system may vary.

.SH "Section SOL_Conf"

This section is for setting up Serial-Over-Lan (SOL) and will only be
available for configuration on those machines.  SOL can be enabled
with the \fIEnable_SOL\fR field.  The minimum privilege level required
for connecting with SOL is specified by \fISOL_Privilege_Level\fR.
This should be set to the maximum privilege level configured to a
username that has SOL enabled.  Typically, this is the "Administrator"
privilege. Authentication and Encryption can be forced or not using
the fields \fIForce_SOL_Payload_Authentication\fR and
\fIForce_SOL_Payload_Encryption\fR respectively.  It is recommended
that these be set on.  However, forced authentication and/or
encryption support depend on the cipher suite IDs supported.
.LP
The \fICharacter_Accumulate_Interval\fR,
\fICharacter_Send_Threshold\fR , \fISOL_Retry_Count\fR and ,
\fISOL_Retry_Interval\fR options are used to set SOL character output
speeds. \fICharacter_Accumulate_Interval\fR determines how often
serial data should be regularly sent and
\fICharacter_Send_Threshold\fR indicates the character count that if
passed, will force serial data to be sent.  \fISOL_Retry_Count\fR
indicates how many times packets must be retransmitted if
acknowledgements are not received.  \fISOL_Retry_Interval\fR indicates
the timeout interval.  Generally, the manufacturer recommended numbers
will be sufficient.  However, you may wish to experiment with these
values for faster SOL throughput.
.LP
The \fINon_Volatile_Bit_Rate\fR and \fIVolatile_Bit_Rate\fR determine
the baudrate the BMC should use.  This should match the baudrate set
in the BIOS and operating system, such as
.B agetty(8).  
Generally speaking, both the \fIVolatile\fR and \fINon_Volatile\fR
options should be set identically.
.LP
In addition to enabling SOL in this section, individual users most
also be capable of connecting with SOL.  See the section 
.B "Section User1, User2, ..." 
above for details.
