.TH ipmiconsole 8 "@ISODATE@" "ipmiconsole @PACKAGE_VERSION@" "System Commands"
.SH "NAME"
ipmiconsole \- IPMI console utility
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.B ipmiconsole
[\fIOPTION\fR...]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.B ipmiconsole
is a Serial-over-LAN (SOL) console utility.  It can be used to establish
console sessions to remote machines using the IPMI 2.0 SOL protocol.

.B Ipmiconsole 
communicates with a remote machine's Baseboard Management Controller
(BMC) to establish a console session.  Before any SOL communication
can take place, the remote machine's BMC must be configured properly.
The FreeIPMI tool
.B ipmi-config(8) 
may be used to do this configuration.
.LP
Often (although not always), console redirection must be also be
configured properly in the BIOS and/or operating system.  Both must be
configured to redirect console traffic out the appropriate COM port.
Please see your motherboard and OS documentation for instructions on
proper setup.

#include <@top_srcdir@/man/manpage-common-outofband-hostname.man>
.TP
\fB\-u\fR, \fB\-\-username\fR=\fIUSERNAME\fR
Specify the username to use when authenticating with the remote host.
If not specified, a null (i.e. anonymous) username is assumed.  The
user must a high enough privilege to establish a SOL session and have
SOL session abilities.
#include <@top_srcdir@/man/manpage-common-outofband-password.man>
#include <@top_srcdir@/man/manpage-common-outofband-k-g.man>
.TP
\fB\-\-session-timeout\fR=\fIMILLISECONDS\fR
Specify the session timeout in milliseconds.  Defaults to 60000
milliseconds (60 seconds) if not specified.
.TP
\fB\-\-retransmission-timeout\fR=\fIMILLISECONDS\fR
Specify the packet retransmission timeout in milliseconds.  Defaults
to 500 milliseconds (0.5 seconds) if not specified.
.TP
\fB\-I\fR, \fB\-\-cipher\-suite-id\fR=\fICIPHER-SUITE-ID\fR
Specify the IPMI 2.0 cipher suite ID to use. The Cipher Suite ID
identifies a set of authentication, integrity, and confidentiality
algorithms to use for IPMI 2.0 communication. The authentication
algorithm identifies the algorithm to use for session setup, the
integrity algorithm identifies the algorithm to use for session packet
signatures, and the confidentiality algorithm identifies the algorithm
to use for payload encryption. Defaults to cipher suite ID 3 if not
specified.  The user should be aware that only cipher suite ids 3, 8,
and 12 encrypt console payloads.  Console information will be sent in
the clear if an alternate cipher suite id is selected.  The following
cipher suite ids are currently supported:

.SH "IPMICONSOLE OPTIONS"
The following options are specific to
.B Ipmiconsole.
.TP
\fB\-e\fR \fICHAR\fR, \fB\-\-escape-char\fR=\fICHAR\fR
Specify an alternate escape character (default char '&').
.TP
\fB\-\-dont-steal\fR
Do not steal an SOL session if one is already detected as being in
use.  Under most circumstances, if SOL is detected as being in use,
.B ipmiconsole
will attempt to steal the SOL session away from the previous session.
This default behavior exists for several reasons, most notably that
earlier SOL sessions may have not been able to be deactivate properly.
.TP
\fB\-\-deactivate\fR
Deactivate SOL session if one is detected as being in use and exit.
.TP
\fB\-\-serial\-keepalive\fR
Occasionally send NUL characters to detect inactive serial
connections.  This option is particularly useful for those who intend
to run
.B ipmiconsole
without much interaction, such as for logging purposes.  While IPMI
connections may still be alive, some motherboards have exhibited bugs
in which underlying serial data can no longer be sent/received.  From
the viewpoint of
.B ipmiconsole,
data is simply not be sent out of the remote system and this problem
is only detected once there is user interaction.  By sending the
occasional NUL character, the underlying loss of serial data transfer
can be detected far more quickly.  There is some risk with this option,
as the NUL character byte may affect the remote system depending on
what data it may or may not be expecting. 
.TP
\fB\-\-serial\-keepalive\-empty\fR
This option is identical to \fB\-\-serial\-keepalive\fR except that
SOL packets will contain no NUL character data.  On some motherboards,
this may be sufficient to deal with a hanging IPMI session without the
risk of regularly sending a NUL character byte may have.  However,
some systems may not ACK a SOL packet without character data in it,
meaning these keepalive packets do nothing.
.TP
\fB\-\-sol\-payload\-instance\fR=\fINUM\fR
Specify the SOL payload instance number.  The default value is 1,
valid values range from 1 to 15.  Most systems only support a single
instance, however a few allow users to access multiple.
.TP
\fB\-\-deactivate\-all\-instances\fR
When used along with the \fB\-\-deactivate\fR option, will deactivate
all active SOL instances instead of just the currently configured
payload instance.
.TP
\fB\-\-lock-memory\fR
Lock sensitive information (such as usernames and passwords) in
memory.
.if @WITH_DEBUG@ \{
.TP
\fB\-\-debugfile\fR
Output debugging to the debugfile rather than to standard output.
.TP
\fB\-\-noraw\fR
Don't enter terminal raw mode.
\}
.LP
.SH "ESCAPE CHARACTERS"
The following escape sequences are supported.  The default supported
escape character is '&', but can be changed with the 
\fB\-e\fR
option.
.TP
.I &?
Display a list of currently available escape sequences.
.TP
.I &.
Terminate the connection.
.TP
.I &B
Send a "serial-break" to the remote console.
.TP
.I &D
Send a DEL character.
.TP
.I &&
Send a single escape character.

.SH "IPMICONSOLE TROUBLESHOOTING"
The following are common issues for error messages in
.B ipmiconsole.
.LP
"SOL unavailable" - SOL is not configured for use on the remote BMC.
It may be not configured in general or for the specific user
specified.  Authenticating with a different user may be sufficient,
however the IPMI protocol does not reveal detail on what is not
configured on the remote BMC.
.LP
"SOL in use" - SOL is already in use on the remote BMC.  If you do not
specify the
.I --dont-steal
option, 
.B ipmiconsole
will attempt to steal the SOL session away from the other session.  Not
all BMCs support the ability to steal away a SOL session.
.LP
"SOL session stolen" - Your SOL session has been stolen by another
session.  You may wish to try and steal the session back by reconnecting.
.LP
"SOL requires encryption" - SOL requires a cipher suite id that
includes encryption.  Please try to use cipher suite id 3, 8, or 12.
It may also be possible the encryption requirements are not configured
correctly on the remote BMC.
.LP
"SOL requires no encryption" - SOL requires a cipher suite id that
does not use encryption.  Please try to use cipher suite id 0, 1, 2,
6, 7, or 11.  It may also be possible the encryption requirements are
not configured correctly on the remote BMC.
.LP
"BMC Implementation" - The BMC on the remote machine has a severe
problem in its implementation.  Please see the WORKAROUNDS section
below for possible workarounds.  If additional vendor workarounds are
required, please contact the authors.
.LP
"excess retransmissions sent" - An excessive number of retransmissions
of SOL packets has occurred and 
.B ipmiconsole
has given up.  This may be due to network issues or SOL issues.  Some
of the same issues involved with "connection timeout" or "session
timeout" errors may be involved.  Please try to reconnect.
.LP
"excess errors received" - An excessive number of SOL packet errors
has occurred and 
.B ipmiconsole
has given up.  This may be due to network issues or SOL issues.
Please try to reconnect.
.LP
"BMC Error" - This error usually means a vendor SOL implementation
requires a combination of authentication, encryption, privilege,
etc. that have not been met by the user's choices.  Please try a
combination of different cipher suites, privileges, etc. to resolve
the problem.  Please see the WORKAROUNDS section below for possible
workarounds too.

#include <@top_srcdir@/man/manpage-common-workaround-heading-text.man>
#include <@top_srcdir@/man/manpage-common-workaround-outofband-common-text.man>
#include <@top_srcdir@/man/manpage-common-workaround-outofband-20-text.man>
.LP
\fIsolpayloadsize\fR - This workaround flag will not check for valid
SOL payload sizes and assume a proper set.  It works around remote
systems that report invalid IPMI 2.0 SOL payload sizes.  Those hitting
this issue may see "BMC Implementation" errors.  Issue observed on
Asus P5M2/RS162-E4/RX4, Intel SR1520ML/X38ML, Inventec 5441/Dell
Xanadu II, Sun x4100, Supermicro X8DTH, Supermicro X8DTG, Supermicro
X8DTU, and Quanta QSSC-S4R//Appro GB812X-CN.
.LP
\fIsolport\fR - This workaround flag will ignore alternate SOL ports
specified during the protocol.  It works around remote systems that
report invalid alternate SOL ports.  Those hitting this issue may see
"connection timeout" errors.  Issue observed on Asus P5MT-R and
Supermicro X8DTH-iF.
.LP
\fIsolstatus\fR - This workaround flag will not check the current
activation status of SOL during the protocol setup.  It works around
remote systems that do not properly support this command.  Those
hitting this issue may see "BMC Error" errors.  Issue observed on
Supermicro X8SIL-F.
.LP
\fIsolchannelsupport\fR - This workaround flag will not check if SOL
is supported on the current channel.  It works around remote systems
that do not properly support this command.  Those hitting this issue
may see "BMC Error" errors.  Issue observed on Intel Windmill, Quanta
Winterfell, and Wiwynn Windmill
.LP
\fIserialalertsdeferred\fR - This workaround option will set serial
alerts to be deferred instead of have them be failures.  This works
around motherboards that perform IPMI over serial along with IPMI
serial over LAN.  Those hitting this issue may see "excess
retransmissions sent" when they attempt to input data via SOL.  Issue
observed on Intel Windmill, Quanta Winterfell, and Wiwynn Windmill.
.LP
\fIsolpacketseq\fR - This workaround option will increment the SOL
payload packet sequence number under dire circumstances.  Normally SOL
should never do this, however some motherboards have shown to get
"stuck" due to an internal bug on the motherboard.  This workaround
can help in getting the BMC un-stuck.  Those hitting this issue may
see "excess retransmissions sent" when they attempt to input data via
SOL.  Issue observed on Intel Windmill, Quanta Winterfell, and Wiwynn
Windmill.
#include <@top_srcdir@/man/manpage-common-known-issues.man>
.LP
Some motherboards define an OEM SOL inactivity timeout for SOL
sessions.  If SOL sessions stay inactive for long periods of time,
.B ipmiconsole
sessions may be abruptly closed, most likely resulting in session
timeout errors.  Please see OEM notes for information on modifying
this parameter if you wish for sessions to stay active longer.
.SH "SPECIFIC HARDWARE NOTES"
Intel SR1520ML/X38ML: After a reboot, the SOL session appears to
"disconnect" from the motherboard but stay alive.  
Character data input from the 
.B ipmiconsole
client is accepted by the remote machine, but no character data or
console data is ever sent back from the remote machine.  The SOL
session is subsequently useless.  There is currently no workaround in
place to handle this.  The session must be closed and restarted.

.SH "EXAMPLES"
.B # ipmiconsole -h ahost -u myusername -p mypassword
.PP
Establish a console sesssion with a remote host.
.PP

.if @WITH_DEBUG@ \{

This version of ipmiconsole was compiled with debugging.  When compiled
with debugging,
.B ipmiconsole 
is insecure.  The following were intentionally
left in
.B ipmiconsole
for debugging purposes:

.IP o 2
Core dumps are enabled.

Before placing ipmiconsole in a production system, it is recommended
that the program be compiled with debugging turned off.
