.TH bmc-watchdog 8 "@ISODATE@" "bmc-watchdog @PACKAGE_VERSION@" "System Commands"
.SH "NAME"
bmc-watchdog \- BMC watchdog timer daemon and control utility
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.B bmc-watchdog 
command [\fIOPTION\fR...] [\fICOMMAND_OPTIONS\fR...]
.br
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.B bmc-watchdog
controls a Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) watchdog timer.  The
.B bmc-watchdog
tool typically executes as a cronjob or daemon to manage the watchdog
timer.  A user must be root in order to run
.B bmc-watchdog. 
.LP
Listed below are
.B bmc-watchdog
details, option details, examples, and known issues.  For a general
introduction to FreeIPMI please see 
.B freeipmi(7).

.SH "BMC WATCHDOG DETAILS"
A BMC watchdog timer is part of the Intelligent Platform Management
Interface (IPMI) specification and is only available to BMCs that are
compliant with IPMI.  When a BMC watchdog timer is started, it begins
counting down to zero from some positive number of seconds.  When the
timer hits zero, the timer will execute a pre-configured pre-timeout
interrupt and/or timeout action.
.LP
In order to stop the pre-timeout interrupt or timeout action from
being executed, the watchdog timer must be periodically reset back to
its initial beginning value.
.LP
The BMC watchdog timer automatically stops itself when the machine is
rebooted.  Therefore, when a machine is brought up, the BMC watchdog
timer must be setup again before it can be used.
.LP
Typically, a BMC watchdog timer is used to automatically reset a
machine that has crashed.  When the operating system first starts up,
the BMC timer is set to its initial countdown value.  At periodic
intervals, when the operating system is functioning properly, the
watchdog timer can be reset by the OS or a userspace program.  Thus,
the timer never counts down to zero.  When the system crashes, the
timer cannot be reset by the OS or userspace program.  Eventually, the
timer will countdown to zero and reset the machine.
.LP
See EXAMPLES below for examples of how bmc-watchdog is commonly used.

.SH "COMMANDS"
The following commands are available to
.B bmc-watchdog.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-set\fR
Set BMC Watchdog Configuration.  BMC watchdog timer configuration
values can be set using the set command options listed below under SET
OPTIONS.  If a particular configuration parameter is not specified on
the command line, the current configuration of that parameter will not
be changed.
.TP
\fB\-g\fR, \fB\-\-get\fR
Get BMC Watchdog Configuration and State.  The current
configuration and state is printed to standard output.
.TP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-reset\fR
Reset BMC Watchdog Timer.  
.TP
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-start\fR                   
Start BMC Watchdog Timer.  Does nothing if the timer is currently
running.  Identical to \fB\-\-reset\fR command when the timer is
stopped with the exception of the start command options listed below
under START OPTIONS.
.TP
\fB\-y\fR, \fB\-\-stop\fR
Stop BMC Watchdog Timer.  Stops the current timer.
.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-clear\fR

for the watchdog timer, except for timer use, which is kept at 
its current value.
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-daemon\fR
Run 
.B bmc-watchdog 
as a daemon.  Configurable BMC watchdog timer options are listed below
under DAEMON OPTIONS.  The configuration values are set once, then the
daemon will reset the timer at specified periodic intervals.  The
daemon can be stopped using the \fB\-\-stop\fR command,
\fB\-\-clear\fR command, or by setting the stop_timer flag on the
\fB\-\-set\fR command.
#include <@top_srcdir@/man/manpage-common-general-options-header.man>

#include <@top_srcdir@/man/manpage-common-workaround-heading-text.man>
#include <@top_srcdir@/man/manpage-common-workaround-inband-text.man>
.LP
\fIignorestateflag\fR - This workaround option will ignore the BMC
timer state flag (indicating if the timer is running or stopped) when
running in daemon mode.  On some BMCs, the flag is broken and will
never report that a BMC timer is running, even if it is.  The
workaround will take notice of changes in the countdown seconds to
determine if a timer is running or stopped.  With this type of
implementation, the reset-period must be large enough to ensure minor
fluctuations in the countdown will not affect the workaround.  Due to
the implementation of this workaround, if another process stops the
watchdog timer, it may be detectable.  This option is confirmed to
work around compliances issues on Sun x4100, x4200, and x4500.

.SH "EXAMPLES" 
.LP 
Setup a bmc-watchdog daemon that resets the machine after 15 minutes
(900 seconds) if the OS has crashed (see default bmc-watchdog rc
script /etc/init.d/bmc-watchdog for a more complete example):
        bmc-watchdog -d -u 4 -p 0 -a 1 -i 900

#include <@top_srcdir@/man/manpage-common-diagnostics.man>
.SH "KNOWN ISSUES"
.B Bmc-watchdog
may fail to reset the watchdog timer if it is not scheduled properly.
It is always recommended that 
.B bmc-watchdog
be executed with a high scheduling priority.
.LP
On some machines, the hardware based SMI Handler may disable a
processor after a watchdog timer timeout if the timer use is set to
something other than SMS/OS.
