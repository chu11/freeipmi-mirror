.B Ipmi-oem
is used to execute OEM specific IPMI commands.  It is intended to
provide a better user interface for OEM specific IPMI commands rather
than using
.B ipmi-raw(8).

Please see SUPPORTED OEM IDS and COMMANDS below for a list of
supported OEM specific IPMI commands.  A list of supported OEM
specific commands may also be generated using the \fB\-\-list\fR
option.

There are no guarantees that the below OEM commands will work on any
particular motherboard.  OEM extensions may or may not exist on
particular hardware revisions and/or firmware revisions of
motherboards.  The extensions may or may not function for other lines of
motherboards from the same manufacturer.

.B slot-power-toggle \fIslot-number\fR
This OEM command will perform a power toggle on a PCIe slot.  The PCIe
slot number can range from 1 to 16.  Command confirmed to work on Dell
Poweredge C410x.
.TP
.B slot-power-control \fIplatform\-model\fR \fIon|off|status\fR \fIslot-number\fR
This OEM command will perform a power control action on a PCIe slot.
This OEM extension is tied very closely to a platform, so a supported
platform must be specified.  The currently supported
\fIplatform\-model\fR options are \fIC410x\fR.  The \fIon\fR action
powers on a slot, \fIoff\fR powers off a slot, and \fIstatus\fR
returns if the current power is on or off.  If the current power
status is on, an \fIon\fR action does nothing.  Similarly, if the
current power status is off, an \fIoff\fR action does nothing.  The
\fIon\fR, \fIoff\fR, and \fIstatus\fR slot power actions are not
native and are emulated through a combination of a power toggle (using
\fIslot\-power\-toggle\fR above) and the reading of PCIe slot watt
sensors.  The PCIe slot number can range from 1 to 16.  Command
confirmed to work on Dell Poweredge C410x.
.TP
.B get-port-map
This OEM command will retrieve the current iPASS mapping to PCIe
controllers/slots.  Command confirmed to work on Dell Poweredge C410x.
.TP
.B set-port-map \fIjumper|bmc\fR \fIipass\-mapping\fR \fI1:2|1:4|1:8\fR
This OEM command will set an iPass mapping to PCIe controllers/slots.
\fIjumper\fR or \fIbmc\fR must be specified to indicate if iPass
mappings will be controlled via jumpers on the system or via a
BMC/IPMI.  In order for reconfiguration to be done via
\fBipmi\-oem\fR, the user must select \fIbmc\fR.  The
\fIipass\-mapping\fR determines which iPass ports will be mapped.
\fI1:2\fR, \fI1:4\fR, and \fI1:8\fR determine the mapping that should
be set.  See details below for specific platforms.  Command confirmed
to work on Dell Poweredge C410x.

For the Dell Poweredge C410x, the \fIipass\-mapping\fR ranges from 1
to 4.  \fI1\fR refers to iPass 1 and 5, \fI2\fR to 2 and 6, \fI3\fR to
3 and 7, and \fI4\fR to 4 and 8.  For the platform \fIC410x\fR, PCIe
slots 1, 2, 3, 4, 13, 14, 15, and 16 are attached to iPass 1, 2, 3,
and 4.  PCIe slots 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 are attached to iPass
5, 6, 7, and 8.  For example, if \fI1:2\fR is set on
\fImapping-number\fR \fI1\fR, PCIe slots 1 and 15 will be assigned to
iPass 1 and slots 2 and 16 will be assigned to iPass 5.  if \fI1:4\fR
is chosen, PCIe slots 1, 2, 15, and 16 will be assigned to iPass 1 and
iPass 5 will not be used.

This OEM command will add or modify an indicated policy ID from the
domain ID.  Most of the fields above are required, although they can
be listed in any order.  By default any created/modified policy will
be enabled, however this can be overridden by \fIpolicystate\fR.
\fIpolicyexceptionaction\fR may be specified multiple times to
configure multiple actions or can be skipped to configure no actions.
When the \fIpolicytrigger\fR is configured as \fInone\fR, the trigger
that will lead to exception actions is the value specified by the
\fIpolicytargetlimit\fR.  When the \fIpolicytrigger\fR is
\fIinlettemperaturelimitpolicytrigger\fR,
\fImissingpowerreadingtimeout\fR, or
\fItimeafterplatformresettrigger\fR, the trigger that will lead to
exception actions is the value specified by \fIpolicytriggerlimit\fR.
When the \fIfIpolicytrigger\fR is \fIboottimepolicy\fR, a power
profile will simply be maintained by the value specified by
\fIpolicytargetlimit\fR.  \fIaggressivepowercorrection\fR defaults to
automatic.  It can only be set to \fInotaggressive\fR or
\fIaggressive\fR if the \fIdomainid\fR is \fIplatform\fR or \fIcpu\fR.
\fIpolicystorage\fR determines if the policy being configured can
survive across resets of the machine.  The units of the
\fIpolicytargetlimit\fR depends on the \fIpolicytrigger\fR selected.
If the \fIpolicytrigger\fR is \fInone\fR,
\fIinlettemperaturelimitpolicytrigger\fR, or
\fItimeafterplatformresettrigger\fR, the units will be in Watts.  If
the \fIpolicytrigger\fR is \fImissingpowerreadingtimeout\fR, the units
will be in percent, where 100 means maximum throttling.  If the
\fIpolicytrigger\fR is \fIboottimepolicy\fR, the units is number of
CPUs.  In addition, \fIplatformbootingmode\fR must be set to
performance or power to indicate optimization mode.
\fIpolicytriggerlimit\fR is sometimes required, given the input to
\fIpolicytrigger\fR.  The units of the \fIpolicytriggerlimit\fR will
depend on the \fIpolicytrigger\fR selected.  If the
\fIpolicytrigger\fR is \fIinlettemperaturelimitpolicytrigger\fR, the
units of \fRpolicytriggerlimit\fR will be in Celsius.  If the
\fIpolicytrigger\fR is \fImissingpowerreadingtimeout\fR or
\fItimeafterplatformresettrigger\fR, the units will be in seconds.  If
the \fIpolicytrigger\fR is \fInone\fR or \fIboottimepolicy\fR, the
\fIpolicytriggerlimit\fR is ignored internally by the Intel Node
Manager and need not be specified..  Typically configuring it to 0 is
more than sufficient.  The \fIcorrectiontimelimit\fR specifies the
time the Node Manager must take corrective actions to bring back the
system within limits before taking the actions specified in
\fIpolicyexceptionaction\fR.  \fIstatisticsreportingperiod\fR is the
number of seconds that measured power will be averaged for reporting.
Please see \fBget\-node\-manager\-policy\fR to determine proper ranges
for \fIpolicytargetlimit\fR, \fIcorrectiontimelimit\fR,
\fIpolicytriggerlimit\fR, and \fIstatisticsreportingperiod\fR.
If \fIdomainid\fR is configured as \fIplatform\fR, user may optionally
set \fIpolicypowerdomain\fR to \fIprimary\fR or \fIsecondary\fR.
Otherwise \fIpolicypowerdomain\fR will be ignored.
