ipmi-config \- configure IPMI values
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.B ipmi-config
[\fIOPTION\fR...]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.B ipmi-config
is used to get and set configuration parameters in IPMI.  In can be
used to configured usernames, passwords, networking information,
security, Serial-over-LAN (SOL), Platform Event Filtering (PEF), boot
devices, power restoration policy, sensor thresholds, sensor
events, and many more configuration options.

Some configuration is typically required before most IPMI
tools can be used to access a machine remotely.  By default,
.B ipmi-config,
will let you \fI\-\-checkout\fR or \fI\-\-commit\fR only the
\fIcore\fR IPMI values necessary for IPMI configuration.  For
additional advanced configuration fields related to Chassis
configuration (including boot options), Platform Event Filtering
(PEF), or Sensors, see the \fI\-\-category\fR option below.

The majority of
configuration operations require ADMIN privilege when using
.B ipmi-config
out-of-band.  Although connecting via a user with ADMIN privileges is
not required for out-of-band use, the vast majority of configuration
options will not be retrieved or set.

.SH "IPMI-CONFIG OPTIONS"
The following options are used to read, write, and find differences
in configuration values.
.TP
\fB\-g\fR \fICATEGORY\fR, \fB\-\-category\fR=\fICATEGORY\fR
Specify the category or categories of configuration data to configure.
Currently available choices: \fIcore\fR, \fIchassis\fR, \fIsensors\fR,
\fIpef\fR, \fIdcmi\fR.  Multiple categories can be separated by comma.
\fIcore\fR includes all major IPMI configuration necessary to get IPMI
to function on a sytem, such as configuration for users, passwords,
authentication, networking, and serial-over-lan (SOL).  \fIchassis\fR
includes all chassis relevant configuration including boot options,
front panel buttons, and power behavior.  \fIdcmi\fR includes
specialized functions provided by the Data Center Management Interface
(DCMI).  Defaults to \fIcore\fR if not specified.
.TP
\fB\-o\fR, \fB\-\-checkout\fR
Fetch configuration information.
.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-commit\fR
Update configuration information from a config file or key pairs.
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-diff\fR
Show differences between stored information and a config file or key pairs.
.TP
\fB\-n\fR \fIFILENAME\fR, \fB\-\-filename\fR=\fIFILENAME\fR
Specify a config file for checkout/commit/diff.  If specified with checkout, cannot
use with multiple hosts or with \fB\-\-always\-prefix\fR.
.TP
\fB\-e\fR \fI"KEY=VALUE"\fR, \fB\-\-key\-pair\fR=\fI"KEY=VALUE"\fR
Specify KEY=VALUE pairs for checkout/commit/diff.  Specify KEY by
SectionName:FieldName.  This option can be used multiple times.  On
commit, any KEY=VALUE pairs will overwrite any pairs specified in a
file with \fB\-\-filename\fR.
.TP
\fB\-S\fR \fISECTION\fR, \fB\-\-section\fR=\fISECTION\fR
Specify a SECTION for checkout.  This option can be used multiple
times.  The SECTION you are specifying must be within the category or
categories specified with \fI\-\-category\fR.
.TP
\fB\-L\fR, \fB\-\-listsections\fR
List available sections for checkout with respect to the category or
categories under \fI\-\-category\fR.  Some sections in the list may
not be checked out by default and may require verbosity to be
increased.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
Output verbose information.  When used with \fI\-\-checkout\fR,
additional uncommon sections and/or fields will be shown.  In the
\fIcore\fR category, this includes checking out Serial Configuration
parameters, Vlan parameters, IPv4 Header parameters, RMCP port, and
sections for each channel on a system, if multiple channels exist.  In
the \fIpef\fR category, this includes checkout out sections for each
channel on a system, if multiple channels exist.
.TP
\fB\-vv\fR
Output very verbose information.  Output additional detailed
information about what fields can and cannot be checked out, and
sometimes the reason why.  Sometimes output fields that are identified
as unsupported on the motherboard.
.TP
\fB\-\-lan\-channel\-number\fR=\fINUMBER\fR
Use an specific channel number for LAN configuration.  Particularly
useful if motherboard contains multiple LAN channels and a user wishes
to use a specific one.
.TP
\fB\-\-serial\-channel\-number\fR=\fINUMBER\fR
Use an specific channel number for serial configuration.  Particularly
useful if motherboard contains multiple serial channels and a user
wishes to use a specific one.
.TP
\fB\-\-sol\-channel\-number\fR=\fINUMBER\fR
Use an specific channel number for SOL configuration.  Particularly
useful if motherboard contains multiple SOL channels and a user
wishes to use a specific one.

.SH "GENERAL USE"
Most users of will want to:
.LP
A) Run with \fI\-\-checkout\fR to get a copy of the current
configuration and store it in a file.  The standard output can be
redirected to a file or a file can be specified with the
\fI\-\-filename\fR option.
.LP
B) Edit the configuration file with an editor.
.LP
C) Commit the configuration back using the \fI\-\-commit\fR option and
specifying the configuration file with the \fI\-\-filename\fR option.
The configuration can be committed to multiple hosts in parallel via
the hostrange support.
.LP
Although not typically necessarily, some motherboards do not store
configuration values in non-volatile memory.  Therefore, after system
reboots, some configuration values may have changed.  The user may
wish to run configuration tools on each boot to ensure configuration
values remain.
.LP
Comments will be listed on occassion in checked out files with information
on how to configure fields.
The 
.B ipmi-config.conf(5)
manpage also provides additional information on the meaning of
different fields.
.LP
For users with large clusters or sets of nodes, you may wish to use
the same configuration file for all nodes.  The one problem with this
is that the IP address and MAC address will be different on each node
in your cluster and thus can't be configured through the same config
file.  The IP address and MAC address in your config file may be
overwritten on the command line using \fI\-\-key\-pair\fR option.  The
following example could be used in a script to configure each node in
a cluster with the same BMC config file.  The script only needs to
determine the correct IP address and MAC address to use.
.LP
.B # ipmi-config --commit -k "Lan_Conf:Ip_Address=$MY_IP" -k "Lan_Conf:Mac_Address=$MY_MAC" --filename=my_bmc.conf
.SH "CORE SPECIAL CASE CONFIGURATION INFORMATION"
The 
.B UserN:Password 
fields (where N is a number) cannot be checked out on some systems,
therefore the checked out value will always be blank.
.LP
The
.B UserN:Enable_User
field (where N is a number) cannot be checked out on older IPMI
systems, therefore the checked out value will sometime be blank.
.LP
The 
.B UserN:Lan_Session_Limit 
and 
.B UserN:Serial_Session_Limit
fields (where N is a number) cannot be checked out on some systems,
therefore the checked out value will always be blank.  If not
specified in later commits of configurations, the field may be reset
to 0 due to a requirement that other fields (configured along with the
session limit) will require an input value for the session limit.
Under most conditions, it is not necessary to set this field and most
users may choose to ignore it.  This field is considered optional by
IPMI standards, and may result in errors when attempting to configure
it to a non-zero value.  If errors to occur, setting the value back to
0 should resolve problems.
.LP
The fields 
.B Lan_Conf:IP_Address 
and 
.B Lan_Conf:MAC_Address 
cannot be committed in parallel via hostrange support.  Each machine
must be configured with a unique IP Address and MAC Address tuple,
therefore we disallow this configuration in
.B ipmi-config.
.LP
On some motherboards,
.B Lan_Conf:MAC_Address
may be read only and the MAC address is automatically configured.
.LP
On some motherboards,
.B Lan_Conf:MAC_Address
may be read only and the MAC address is configured via an OEM command.  See
.B ipmi-oem(8)
to see if OEM configuration for your motherboard is supported.
.LP
On some motherboards, a number of user configuration fields cannot be
read or configured until after a non-null username or non-null
password is configured.  In some of these cases, an appropriate output
in the config file will indicate this situation.  However, not all
motherboard corner cases may be detected.  Users may wish to play
around with the ordering of fields to work around these problems.
.LP
On some motherboards, OEM Authentication in
.B Lan_Conf_Auth
cannot be enabled.  However, the default motherboard settings have
these fields enabled.  Users are advised to disable all OEM
Authentication in this section.
.LP
On some motherboards, multiple channels may exist for either LAN or
Serial IPMI communication.  If multiple channels exist, configuration
of both channels can be viewed and ultimately configured by running
\fI\-\-checkout\fR under verbose mode.  Each section or key name will
be suffixed appropriately with the word \fIChannel\fR and the channel
number.  For example, you might see a \fILan_Conf_Channel_1\fR and
\fILan_Conf_Channel_3\fR, where you can configure LAN configuration on
Channels 1 and 3 respectively.
.LP
On some motherboards, configuration changes will not be "absorbed" by
the system until the motherboard is hard-reset.  This can be accomplished
by physically powering off and on the system (e.g. button push), or it can be
accomplished through a cold-reset.  A cold-reset can be executed via
.B bmc-device.

.SH "CHASSIS SPECIAL CASE CONFIGURATION INFORMATION"
The
.B Chassis_Front_Panel_Buttons:Enable_Standby_Button_For_Entering_Standy,
.B Chassis_Front_Panel_Buttons:Enable_Diagnostic_Interrupt_Button
.B Chassis_Front_Panel_Buttons:Enable_Reset_Button,
and
.B Chassis_Front_Panel_Buttons:Enable_Power_Off_Button_For_Power_Off_Only
fields may not be able to be checked out on some IPMI systems, therefore
the checked out value may be blank.  Some of these fields may be 
disableable, while some are not.

The
.B Chassis_Power_Conf:Power_Control_Interval 
field cannot be checked out.  Therefore the checked out value will
always be blank.

.SH "PEF SPECIAL CASE CONFIGURATION INFORMATION"
On some motherboards, multiple channels may exist for LAN IPMI
communication.  If multiple channels exist, configuration of both
channels can be viewed and ultimately configured by running
\fI\-\-checkout\fR under verbose mode.  Each section name will be
suffixed appropriately with the word \fIChannel\fR and the channel
number.  For example, you might see a \fICommunity_String_Channel_1\fR
and \fICommunity_String_Channel_3\fR, where you can configure the
Community String on Channels 1 and 3 respectively.

The following are the options suitable for input for Sensor_Type in
PEF configuration. 
.TP

.SH "SENSORS SPECIAL CASE CONFIGURATION INFORMATION"
Since many configurable fields involve decimal numbers,
precision/floating point inaccuracies may occur when configuring new
thresholds.  The inaccuracies may not be apparent immediately.  It is
recommend users verify their changes after configuring new thresholds.

.LP
\fIslowcommit\fR - This workaround will slow down commits to the BMC
by sleeping one second between the commit of sections.  It works
around motherboards that have BMCs that can be overwhelmed by commits.
Those hitting this issue may see commit errors or commits not being
written to the BMC.  Issue observed on Supermicro H8QME.
.LP
\fIveryslowcommit\fR - This workaround will slow down commits to the
BMC by sleeping one second between the commit of every key.  It works
around motherboards that have BMCs that can be overwhelmed by commits.
Those hitting this issue may see commit errors or commits not being
written to the BMC.  Issue observed on Quanta S99Q/Dell FS12-TY.
.LP
\fIsolchannelassumelanchannel\fR - This workaround will force
.B ipmi-config
to assume that the channel used SOL is identical to the channel used
for LAN.  On some motherboards, the SOL channel is reported
incorrectly, leading to incorrect configuration.  Most notably, this
problem has come up when attempting to configure multiple channels.
Issue observed on Intel S5500WBV/Penguin Relion 700.
