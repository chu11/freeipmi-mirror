.TH IPMIPING 8 "@ISODATE@" "ipmiping @PACKAGE_VERSION@" "System Commands"
.SH "NAME"
ipmiping \- send IPMI Get Authentication Capabilitiy request to network hosts 
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.B ipmiping [OPTIONS] destination
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.B ipmiping
uses the IPMI Get Authentication Capabilities request datagram to
elicit an IPMI Get Authentication Capabilitiesl response from a remote
host.  The utility can be used to verify if a remote host supports
IPMI.  The initial starting sequence number will be randomized.

.B ipmiping 
will return 0 to the environment if it receives atleast 1 response 
from the remote host.  Otherwise, it exists with a value of 1.
.SH OPTIONS
The following options are available 
.TP
.I "-h"
Output help menu.
.TP
.I "-V"
Output version.
.TP
.I "-c count"
Stop after sending 
.I count
request packets.
.TP
.I "-i interval"
Wait 
.I interval 
seconds between sending each packet.  The default is to wait for one
second between each packet.
.TP
.I "-I interface address"
Set source address to specified interface address. Argument may
be numeric IP address or name of device.
.TP
.I "-t timeout"
Time to wait for a response, in seconds. Default is five seconds.
.TP
.I "-v"
Verbose output.
.TP
.I "-s num"
Specify an initial starting sequence number.  The default is to use a
random initial sequence number.
.if @WITH_DEBUG@ \{
.TP
.I "-d"
Turn on debugging.
\}
.SH "KNOWN ISSUES"
It has been observed that some remote BMCs can get "confused" and
delay packet responses if duplicate packets are sent in succession
very quickly.  For example, this could happen if the user repeatedly
executes "ipmiping -c 1 destination" very quickly.  There is no known
way to cleanly deal with a "confused" BMC.  The best option is to
simply wait "awhile".
.SH "ORIGIN"
Developed by Albert Chu <chu11@llnl.gov> on LLNL's GNU/Linux clusters.
This software is open source and distributed under the terms of the
Gnu GPL.  Command and manpage based off 
.B ping(8).
