Specify the IPMI 2.0 cipher suite ID to use.  The Cipher Suite ID
identifies a set of authentication, integrity, and confidentiality
algorithms to use for IPMI 2.0 communication.  The authentication
algorithm identifies the algorithm to use for session setup, the
integrity algorithm identifies the algorithm to use for session packet
signatures, and the confidentiality algorithm identifies the algorithm
to use for payload encryption.  Defaults to cipher suite ID 3 if not
specified.  The following cipher suite id's are currently supported:
