.LP
By default, standard output from each node specified will be output
with the hostname prepended to each line.  Although this output is
readable in many situations, it may be difficult to read in other
situations. For example, output from multiple nodes may be mixed
together.  The \fB\-B\fR and \fB\-C\fR options can be used to change
this default.
