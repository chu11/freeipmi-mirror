.SH "NAME"
libfreeipmi - FreeIPMI library
.SH Introduction
Libfreeipmi is the primary library that most of the FreeIPMI tools are based
upon.  The following describe the sub-sections of the library.
.TP
.B api
Provides the highest level API provided by libfreeipmi.  It
abstracts away the details of inband and outofband protocols from
the user.  It also provides useful error codes for the user to
easily interpret.  'api' is used by most FreeIPMI tools and
libraries, such as bmc-info, ipmi-sensors, and libipmimonitoring.
.TP
.B cmds
Provides fiid templates and 'fill' functions for IPMI
commands.  Also provides macros definining common parameters for
IPMI commands.  The cmds are used by most other portions of
libfreeipmi including the 'api' sub-section and tools such as
.B ipmipower(8) 
and 
.B ipmiconsole(8).
.TP
.B debug
Provides various packet/record dumping utility functions.
Utilized by the 'api' subsection and by tools such as 
.B ipmipower(8) 
and
.B ipmiconsole(8).
.TP
.B driver
Provides APIs for in-band IPMI communication.  Currently
supported drivers are KCS, SSIF, and OpenIPMI.  The 'driver'
subsction is used by tools such as 
.B bmc-watchdog(8) 
and the 'api' sub-section.
.TP
.B fiid
The "FreeIPMI Interface Definition" provides an API used for
the construction/deconstruction of packets in libfreeipmi.  The API
works around fiid-templates, which are then used to create
fiid-objects.  Fiid-templates are used to describe packets through
a string-name to bit-field mapping.  The API allows users to
read/write fields in an object using the string to bit-field
mapping.  Marshalling, packing, endian, and various other network
issues are handled within 'fiid'.  Fiid objects are used throughout
libfreeipmi, including the 'api' sub-section, 'cmds' sub-sections,
and various tools.
.TP
.B interface
Provides 'assemble' and 'disassemble' functions for building packets
for individual in-band or out-of-band protocols.  Also provides all
necessary fiid templates, 'fill' functions, and other utility
functions necessary to communicate on an IPMI interface.  Utilized by
the 'api' sub-section and tools such as 
.B ipmipower(8) and 
.B ipmiconsole(8).
.TP
.B locate
Provides an API to probe several standards to find default values for
in-band IPMI communication.  Utilized by the 'api' sub-section and the
.B ipmi-locate(8) 
tool.
.TP
.B record-format
Provides macros, fiid-templates, and information on records used in
IPMI.  Utilized by the 'sdr-cache' subsection and tools like 
.B ipmi-sensors(8).
.TP
.B sdr-cache
Provides and API for creating, caching, reading, and parsing a sensor
data repository (SDR).  Utilized by tools such as
.B ipmi-sensors(8),
and 
.B ipmimonitoring(8).
.TP
.B spec
Provides macros and arrays for various other definitions and tables in
IPMI.  Utilized by tools such as 
.B ipmi-sensors(8).
.TP
.B util
Provides various utility functions for the calculation of keys, sensor
readings, etc.  Utilized by most of the rest of FreeIPMI.
