.TH ipmipower 8 "@ISODATE@" "ipmipower @PACKAGE_VERSION@" "System Commands"
.SH "NAME"
ipmipower \- IPMI power control utility
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.B ipmipower
.I "[OPTIONS]"
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.B ipmipower
allows users to remotely power on, off, cycle, hard reset, get a power
status query, perform a pulse diagnostic interrupt, or initiate a
soft-shutdown of the OS via ACPI through the IPMI over LAN protocol.
See IPMI over LAN below for more information on IPMI.

When a power command (--on, --off, --cycle, --reset, --stat, --pulse,
or --soft) is specified on the command line,
.B ipmipower 
will attempt to run the power command on all hostnames listed on the
command line then exit.

If no power commands are specified on the command line, 
.B ipmipower 
will run in interactive mode.  Interactive mode gives the user a
command line interface to enter various commands.  Details of the
interactive command line interface can be found below under
INTERACTIVE COMMANDS.

See EXAMPLES below for examples of how ipmipower is commonly used.

.SH "BASIC OPTIONS"
The following options are the most common options used with  
.B ipmipower.
.TP
.I "-h, --hostnames host1,host2,..."
Specify the list of remote hosts to be controlled by 
.B ipmipower.  
This option is required if a power command (--on, --off, --cycle,
--reset, --stat, --pulse, or --soft) is specified on the command line.
Hostnames may be specified in a range format; see HOST RANGES below.
.TP
.I "-u, --username name"
Sets the username to use when authenticating with the remote host.
The user must have OPERATOR or ADMINISTRATOR privilege to run the
--on, --off, --reset, --cycle, --pulse, or --soft power control
commands.  The user only needs USER privileges to determine the power
status of the machine through --stat.  If not specified, a null
(i.e. anonymous) username is assumed.
.TP
.I "-p, --password pw"
Sets the password to use when authenticating with the BMC.  If not
specified, a null password is assumed.
.TP
.I "-P, --password-prompt"
Prompt for password to avoid possibility of listing it in process
lists.
.TP
.I "-k, --k-g str"
Sets the K_g BMC Key to use when authenticating with the BMC for
ipmi 2.0.  If not specified, a null key is assumed.  To input the key
in hexadecimal form, prefix the string with '0x'.  E.g., the key 'abc'
can be entered with the either the string 'abc' or the
string '0x616263'
.TP
.I "-K, --k-g-prompt"
Prompt for K_g to avoid possibility of listing it in process
lists.  To input the key in hexadecimal form, prefix the string
with '0x'.
.TP
.I "-n, --on"
Power on the target hosts.
.TP
.I "-f, --off"
Power off the target hosts.
.TP
.I "-c, --cycle"
Power cycle the target hosts.
.TP
.I "-r, --reset"
Reset the target hosts.
.TP
.I "-s, --stat"
Get power status of the target hosts.
.TP
.I "-j, --pulse"
Send power diagnostic interrupt to target hosts.
.TP
.I "-m, --soft"
Initiate a soft-shutdown of the OS via ACPI.
.TP
.I "-H, --help"
Output help menu and exit.
.TP
.I "-V, --version"
Output version and exit.
.if @WITH_DEBUG@ \{
.TP
.I "--config file"
Specify alternate configuration file.
\}
.LP
.SH "ADVANCED OPTIONS"
The following advanced options are used to change the default behavior
of 
.B ipmipower.
.TP
.I "-a, --authentication-type str"
Sets the IPMI 1.5 authentication type to use with 
.B ipmipower.  
The currently available authentication types are "auto", "none",
"straight_password_key", "md2", and "md5".  If not specified, 
.B ipmipower
uses "auto" authentication, which will automatically select the most
secure authentication mechanism available from the remote machine.
.TP
.I "-l, --privilege-level str"
Sets the privilege type to use with 
.B ipmipower.  
The currently available privilege types are "auto", "user",
"operator", and "admin".  If not specified,
.B ipmipower
uses "auto", which will automatically select the minimal privilege
required for the power control operation selected.  Atleast the
"operator" is required for --on, --off, --cycle, --reset, --pulse, or
--soft.  The "user" privilege is sufficient for --stat.
.TP
.I "-R, --ipmi-version version"
Set the IPMI protocol version to use.  The currently available versions
are "auto", "1.5", and "2.0".  If not specified,
.B ipmipower
uses "auto", which will try find an IPMI protocol version that is
suitable.  IPMI 1.5 is given weight over IPMI 2.0.
.TP
.I "-I, --cipher-suite-id id"
Set the IPMI 2.0 Cipher Suite ID to use.  The Cipher Suite ID identifies
a set of authentication, integrity, and confidentiality algorithms to 
use for IPMI 2.0 communication.  The authentication algorithm identifies
the algorithm to use for session setup, the integrity algorithm identifies
the algorithm to use for session packet signatures, and the confidentiality
algorithm identifies the algorithm to use for payload encryption.  If not specified
.B ipmipower
uses the "auto" cipher suite, which will automatically select the most
secure sipher suite available from the remote machine.  The following
cipher suite id's are currently supported:
.sp
auto - Select the most secure cipher suite available from the remote machine
.sp
0 - Authentication Algorithm = None; Integrity Algorithm = None; Confidentiality Algorithm = None
.sp
1 - Authentication Algorithm = HMAC-SHA1; Integrity Algorithm = None; Confidentiality Algorithm = None

.TP
.I "-g, --on-if-off"
The IPMI specification does not require the power cycle or hard reset
commands to turn on a machine that is currently powered off.  This
option will force
.B ipmipower 
to issue a power on command instead of a power cycle or hard reset
command if the remote machine's power is currently off.
.TP
.I "-A, --wait-until-on"
The IPMI specification allows power on commands to return prior the
power on actually taking place.  This option will force
.B ipmipower 
to regularly query the remote BMC and return only after the machine
has powered on.
.TP
.I "-B, --wait-until-off"
The IPMI specification allows power off commands to return prior the
power off actually taking place.  This option will force
.B ipmipower 
to regularly query the remote BMC and return only after the machine
has powered off.
.TP
.I "-C, --consolidate-output"
Consolidate 
.B ipmipower 
output.  Consolidated output can be used to shorten output if the
number of nodes being power controlled is quite large.  However,
hostrange output will only output after all machines have completed
their power control operation. See HOST RANGES below.
.TP
.I "-E, --eliminate"
Eliminate hosts determined as undetected by
.B ipmidetect.
This attempts to remove the common issue of execution timing out due
to several nodes being removed from service in a large cluster. The
.B ipmidetectd
daemon must be running on the node executing the command.  Only works
in non-interactive mode.  See HOST RANGES below for additional
information.
.TP
.I "-W, --workaround-flags str"
Informs
.B ipmipower
to use one of the several possible workarounds to get around vendor
specific IPMI compliance issues.  Multiple workarounds can be
specified separated by commas. For information on available
workarounds, see WORKAROUNDS below.
.if @WITH_DEBUG@ \{
.TP
.I "--debug"
Turn on debugging output.
.TP
.I "--ipmidump"
Turn on IPMI packet dump output. Warning, the dump output can get
extremely long.
.TP
.I "--rmcpdump"
Turn on RMCP packet dump output.  Warning, the dump output can get 
extremely long.
.TP
.I "--log"
Turn on logging.  Default logfile is /tmp/ipmipower.PID, where PID is
the current process id.
.TP
.I "--logfile"
Change current logfile.
\}
.LP
.SH "NETWORK OPTIONS"
The following options are used to change the behavior of
.B ipmipower's 
network behavior.
.TP
.I "-t, --timeout ms"
Sets the timeout in milliseconds.  
.B Ipmipower 
uses the timeout value to determine when to give up on a power control
command.  If not specified, a default timeout of 20000 milliseconds
(20 seconds) is used.
.TP
.I "-y, --retry-timeout ms"
Sets the retry-timeout in milliseconds.  IPMI over LAN requires a
series of packets to be sent back and forth to a remote host BMC.
When a response to any individual packet is not received after
retry-timeout milliseconds,
.B ipmipower
will retry sending that packet.  If not specified, packet
retransmissions will occur after 400 milliseconds (0.4 seconds).  The
value "ms" must be less than the timeout length specified with
--timeout.  Packet retransmissions can be disabled by setting the
retry-timeout length to 0.

Note how this option differs from the "--timeout" option above.  The
"--timeout" option refers to the entire amount of time the IPMI
protocol has to complete a power control operation.  The
"--retry-timeout" option refers to the amount of time any individual
packet within the IPMI protocol has to complete.
.TP
.I "-q, --retry-wait-timeout ms"
Sets the retry-wait-timeout in milliseconds.  The retry-wait-timeout
is similar to the 'retry-timeout' above, but is used specifically for
power completion verification in the "--wait-until-on" and
"--wait-until-off" options.
.TP
.I "-b, --retry-backoff-count num"
After every retry-backoff-count retransmissions, 
.B ipmipower 
will increase the retry-timeout length by another factor for the
duration of the current power control operation.  This is done to
reduce network traffic and allow BMC buffers to empty.  If not
specified, retry-backoff-count is 8.  Retransmission backoff can be
disabled by setting the retry backoff count to 0.
.TP
.I "-i, --ping-interval ms"
.TP
.I "-z, --ping-timeout ms"
When running in interactive mode, 
.B ipmipower 
will send RMCP (Remote Management Control Protocol) ping discovery
messages every ping-interval milliseconds to discover all remote hosts
and confirm its support of IPMI.  Power comamnds cannot be sent to a
host until it is discovered (or possibly re-discovered).  A remote
host is considered undiscovered if the host does not respond to RMCP
ping messages within ping-timeout milliseconds.  When a host is
considered undiscovered, power control commands will not be sent to
it.  If not specified, ping-interval is 5000 milliseconds (5 seconds)
and ping-timeout is 30000 milliseconds (30 seconds).  Ping discovery
requests can be disabled by setting the ping interval to 0.  If ping
discovery messages are disabled, power commands will be attempted
without knowledge of the host's existence or its support of IPMI.  The
value of ping-interval must be less than the ping-timeout length.
RMCP ping discovery messages are automatically disabled in
non-interactive mode.
.TP
.I "-v, --ping-packet-count num"
.TP
.I "-w, --ping-percent num"
Since IPMI is based off of a UDP protocol, it is difficult for
.B ipmipower
to distinguish between a missing machine and a bad network connection
when running in interactive mode.  For example, suppose a link
consistently drops 80% of the packets to a particular machine.  The
power control operation may have difficulty completing, although a
recent pong response from RMCP makes
.B ipmipower 
believe the machine is up and functioning properly.  

The --ping-packet-count and --ping-percent options are used to
alleviate this problem.
.B Ipmipower 
will monitor RMCP ping packets in ping-packet-count chunks.  If
.B ipmipower 
does not receive a response to greater than ping-percent of those
packets,
.B ipmipower 
will assume the link to this node is bad and will not send power
control operations to that node until the connection is determined to
be reliable.  If not specified, ping-packet-count is 10 and
ping-percent is 50.  This heuristic can be disabled by setting either
ping-packet-count or ping-percent to 0.  This feature is not used if
ping-interval is set to 0.  Note that the --ping-percent option takes
an integer as an argument, not a decimal.
.TP
.I "-x, --ping-consec-count num"
Ping-consec-count is another heuristic used to determine if a node
should be considered discovered, undiscovered, or with a bad
connection.  If a valid RMCP pong response was received for the last
ping-consec-count RMCP ping packets, a node will be considered
discovered, regardless if ping-packet-count and ping-percent
statistically consider the link to be unreliable.  If not specified,
ping-consec-count is 5.  This feature can be disabled by setting
ping-consec-count to 0.  This feature is not used if ping-interval,
--ping-packet-count, or --ping-percent are set to 0.
.LP
.SH "INTERACTIVE COMMANDS"
.B ipmipower
provides the following interactive commands at the ipmipower> prompt.

.SH "HOST RANGES"
As noted above, 
.B ipmipower
accepts a range of hostnames in the general form: prefix[n-m,l-k,...],
where n < m and l < k, etc., as an alternative to explicit comma
seperated lists of hosts.  This form should not be confused with
regular expression character classes (also denoted by []). For
example, foo[19] does not represent foo1 or foo9, but rather
represents a degenerate range: foo19.
.LP
This range syntax is meant only as a convenience on clusters with a
prefixNN naming convention and specification of ranges should not be
considered necessary -- the list foo1,foo9 could be specified as such,
or by the range foo[1,9].
.LP
Some examples of range usage follow:
.nf
    foo[01-05] instead of foo01,foo02,foo03,foo04,foo05
    foo[7,9-10] instead of foo7,foo9,foo10
    foo[0-3] instead of foo0,foo1,foo2,foo3
.fi
.LP
As a reminder to the reader, some shells will interpret brackets ([
and ]) for pattern matching.  Depending on your shell, it may be
necessary to enclose ranged lists within quotes.
.LP
By default, power control results will be output one to each
line. Although this output is readable in many situations, it may be
difficult to read in other situations. The \fB\-C\fR option can be
used to change this default.

.SH "TROUBLESHOOTING"
Most often, problems with ipmipower involve a misconfiguration of the
remote machine's BMC.  The FreeIPMI tool
.B bmc-config(1) 
may be used to do this configuration.  Double check to make sure the
following are configured properly in the remote machine's BMC: IP
address, MAC address, subnet mask, username(s), password(s), allowed
authentication type(s), atleast OPERATOR privilege level for one user,
enabled LAN activity.

When powering on a powered off machine, the client must have a means
by which to resolve the MAC address of the remote machine's ethernet
card.  This is typically done in one of two ways.

1) Enable gratuitous ARPs on the remote machine.  The remote machine
will send out a gratuitous ARP, which advertises the ethernet IP and
MAC address so that other machines on the network this information
their local ARP cache.  For large clusters, this method is not
recommended since gratuitous ARPs can flood the network with
unnecessary traffic.

2) Permanently store the remote machine's MAC address in the local ARP
cache.  This is the more common approach on large clusters.

Other methods are listed in the IPMI specification.

If 
.B ipmipower 
is running a tad slow when running a power control command on the
commandline (compared to running a power control command in
interactive mode), hostname IP resolution may be slowing the startup
code down.  Hostname resolution tuning may help make
.B ipmipower 
execute faster on the commandline.  This performance problem should
not matter when running in interactive mode or with
.B powerman, 
since it is a one-time setup cost.

If 
.B ipmipower
attempts are constantly timing out, increasing the retry timeout to
a few seconds may help.  Some remote BMCs are considerably slower
than others.

.SH "KNOWN ISSUES"
In order to prevent brute force attacks, some BMCs will "lock up"
after a number of username, password, or privilege errors.  There is
no known way to cleanly deal with a "locked up" BMC.  The best option
is to simply wait "awhile".

On certain operating systems, if you input your username and password
on the command line, the username and password may be discovered by
other users when using the
.B ps(1) 
command or looking in the /proc file system.  More secure solutions
are to configure this information in the config file, in interactive
mode, or with the -P and -K options.

IPMI specifications do not require BMCs to perform a power control
operation before returning a completion code to the caller.
Therefore, it is possible for
.B ipmipower 
to return power status queries opposite of what you are expecting.
For example, if a "power off" operation is performed, a BMC may return
a successful completion code to
.B ipmipower
before the "power off" operation is actually performed.  Subsequent
power status queries may return "on" for several seconds, until the
BMC actually performs the "power off" operation.

.if @WITH_DEBUG@ \{

This version of ipmipower was compiled with debugging.  When compiled
with debugging,
.B ipmipower 
is insecure.  The following were intentionally
left in
.B ipmipower
for debugging purposes:

.IP o 2
Sensitive command line arguments are not cleared from memory.
.IP o
Core dumps are enabled.
.IP o
In interactive mode, commands may output sensitive information
to stdout.
.IP o
Configuration info such as username and password can be output to the
log file.

Before placing ipmipower in a production system, it is recommended
that the program be compiled with debugging turned off.
