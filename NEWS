0.5.0
-----
For Users
---------
o Added previously missing IPMI 2.0 support into other FreeIPMI
  tools (-D LAN_2_0)
o Ported previously missing IPMI compliance workarounds into other
  FreeIPMI tools (-W, --workaround-flags option)
o Ported many features from other tools into ipmimonitoring. 
o Added openipmi driver to bmc-watchdog.
o Refined many error messages to provide more accurate descriptions of
  errors.
o Removed OEM privilege capabilities in most tools, since there's no
  point to them.
o Updated most manpages with full and clearer information.
o Made many command line options consistent across FreeIPMI.  Notable
  changes include:
  1) All --priv-level and --privilege options are now --privilege-level
  2) All --auth-type options are now --authentication-type
  3) All --reg-space or --register-space options are now --register-spacing
  4) In ipmipower, --hostnames (plural) is now --hostname (not-plural).  
     Internally --hostnames is maintained for backwards compatability.
  5) In ipmipower, --timeout is now --session-timeout.
     Internally, --timeout is maintained for backwards compatability.
  5) The -T option and -I option in ipmipower have been flipped for consistency.
  6) The -c option in ipmiconsole is now the -I option.  The -c option is
     internally maintained for backwards comptability.
  7) Compliance workaround options in ipmiconsole now follow the convention
     in ipmipower using the -W option.
  8) The "plain" authentication type argument is now the
     "straight_password_key" authentication type argument.  "plain" is
     internally maintained for backwards compatability.
  9) Short option -I changed to -D in bmc-watchdog for consistency to
     other tools.
  10) The short option -r for --register-spacing has been removed.
  11) Short options for most debugging options have been removed.
  12) All "--retry" options are now "--retransmission" options.
o Similarly, renamed configuration file options or interactive prompt
  options for consistency with command line.
o Similarly, updated manpages for consistency across tools.
o Fixed various configuration file options or interactive prompt option
  inconsistencies with dashes vs. underscores.
o Removed the quiet and silent options from bmc-config.

For Developers
--------------
o Added IPMI 2.0 into UDM 
o Added workarounds into UDM for IPMI 1.5 and IPMI 2.0 known
  compliance issues from vendors.
o Fix various library variable names and macros for consistency.  For
  example:
  1) ipmi_ver_minor and ipmi_ver_major in struct ipmi_locate_info have
     been renamed to ipmi_version_minor and ipmi_version_major.
  2) reg_space/register_spacing has been renamed to register_spacing globally.
  3) privilege has been replaced to privilege_level globally.
  4) Various FreeIPMI library error codes have been renamed for consistency.
     For example OUTMEM has been changed to OUT_OF_MEMORY globally.
