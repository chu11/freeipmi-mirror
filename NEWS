0.5.0
-----
For Users
---------
o Added IPMI 2.0 support into many core FreeIPMI tools (-D LAN_2_0)
o Ported many IPMI compliance workarounds into all tools (-W,
  --workaround-flags option)
o Made many command line options consistent across FreeIPMI.  Notable
  changes include:
  1) All --priv-level and --privilege options are now --privilege-level
  2) All --auth-type options are now --authentication-type
  3) The -T option in ipmipower is now the -I option.
  4) The -c option in ipmiconsole is now the -I option (-c is
     internally maintained for backwards comptability).
  5) Compliance workaround options in ipmiconsole now follow the convention
     in ipmipower using the -W option.
  6) The "plain" authentication type argument is now the
     "straight_password_key" authentication type argument.  "plain" is internally
     maintained for backwards compatability.
o Renamed configuration file options or interactive prompt options for 
  consistency with command line.
o Fix various configuration file options or interactive prompt options
  inconsistencies with dashes vs. underscores.
