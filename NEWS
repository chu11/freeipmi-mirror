FreeIPMI 1.7.1 - XX/XX/XX
-------------------------

In 2019 the IPMI standard was frozen.  So a decision was made to try
and make the FreeIPMI 1.7.X line the last stable line in FreeIPMI.  A
number of decisions were made to remove legacy support and fix minor issues,
even at the cost of breaking backwards compatibility.

Updated Features:
-----------------

Libraries
---------
o libfreeipmi/sensor-read: Add error for privilege level insufficient.
o In libfreeipmi, support Intel S2600BPB OEM SEL interpretations.
o Significant refactoring of Intel OEM extensions.  Names of
  variables, macros, etc. may have changed.

Tools
-----
o In ipmi-sel, support Intel S2600BPB OEM SEL interpretations.
o In ipmi-config, support configuration of Maximum_Privilege_Cipher_Suite_Id_16.

o Support significant portions of IPMI IPv6 configuration in
  libfreeipmi.
o Add --no-session option in ipmi-raw.
o Add SDR cache options to ipmi-config.
o Legacy -f short option for --flush-cache and -Q short option for
  quiet-cache.  Backwards compatible for tools that supported it
  before.
o In ipmi-oem, support Gigabyte get-bmc-services and set-bmc-services.
o Various performance improvements:
  - Remove excessive calls to secure_memset to clear memory.
  - Remove excessive memsets and clears of data.
  - Remove unnecessary "double input checks".
  - Remove expensive input checks in libfreeipmi fiid library.
    Fallout from this may include FIID_ERR_FIELD_NOT_FOUND errors in
    different fiid functions.
  - Remove unnecessary input checks in libfreeipmi fiid library.
  - Add recent 'lookups' of fields in fiid library to internal cache.
o Various minor fixes/improvements
  - Update libfreeipmi core API to use poll() instead of select(), to
    avoid issues with applications with a high number of threads.

FreeIPMI 1.5.7 - 08/16/17
-------------------------
o In libipmimonitoring, fix several mem-leak corner cases.

FreeIPMI 1.5.6 - 07/05/17
-------------------------
o In libfreeipmi locate (used by ipmi-locate), use DMI firmware in
  sysfs if it exists.

FreeIPMI 1.5.5 - 11/02/16
-------------------------
o Fix invalid flag clear in libipmiconsole that can lead to a potential
  double close on a file descriptor.
o Support Supermicro H8SGL-F OEM sensors and events.

FreeIPMI 1.5.4 - 09/30/16
-------------------------
o Various changes/fixes in libipmiconsole
  - If user retrieves file descriptor from ipmiconsole_ctx_fd, user is
    required to close it.  ipmiconsole_ctx_destroy no longer closes
    it.  This is to avoid a potential double close which can be a
    problem for multithreaded applications.  This is a change in
    behavior, but we do not believe this will affect most applications
    since most users close the file descriptor under most scenarios
    anyways.
  - ipmiconsole_ctx_destroy() should now be called to free resources
    even if ipmiconsole_engine_teardown() has been called.  This has
    been done to create consistent behavior in the API and avoid a
    former segfault possibility.  This is a change in behavior, but we
    do not believe this will affect most applications since
    ipmiconsole_engine_teardown() is only called when an application
    is being shutdown.
  - The use of IPMICONSOLE_ENGINE_CLOSE_FD has been clarified in the
    header file.  Some of the prior text was unclear.  Behavior has
    not been changed.
o In ipmi-oem, support Intel get-bmc-services and set-bmc-services commands.
o In ipmi-oem, support Gigabyte get-nic-mode and set-nic-mode commands.
o Support Gigabyte MD90-FS0-ZB OEM SEL events.

    and diff new sections/fields not yet covered in the four former
    tools.
  - Legacy scripts for bmc-config, ipmi-pef-config,
    ipmi-sensors-config, and ipmi-chassis-config will point to the new
    tool with all appropriate options to ensure full backwards
    compatability.
  - The ipmi-pef-config --info option has been made legacy.  It is
    still supported but no longer advertised.
o Support Intel Data Center Host Interface / Management Engine as

  not just non-threshold sensors.  Resulted in an API change.
o Removed many short options for more consistent command line
  "architecture" between tools and to ensure short options are more
  consistent between tools.  Limit short options to only the most
  popular options.  Short options have been removed from ipmipower,

Tools - Enhancements/Changes/Bug Fixes
--------------------------------------
o Global in most tools
  - Rename --no-probing option to --disable-auto-probe for consistency
    in FreeIPMI.  Backwards compatability maintained.
o Global in config tools (bmc-config, pef-config, ipmi-sensors-config)
  - More carefully check for fatal vs. non-fatal errors when
    performing configuration.  This change may result in slight
    behavior differences.  For example, a session-timeout may have
    previously been considered a non-fatal error, making the config
    tools continue on attempting more configuration activities.  Now,
    it would error out on the first session-timeout indication.
o ipmi-sensors
  - Check variety of corner cases such as whether sensor readings,
    hysteresis, thresholds, etc. are even available before reading
    them.  Some sensors may output slightly different information than
    before.  For example, suppose a power supply sensor exists for a
    power supply that is not installed.  If the sensor is enabled on
    the motherboard, ipmi-sensors would likely report "OK".  If the
    sensor is disabled on the motherboard, ipmi-sensors would now likely
    report "NA".  Previously, "OK" would have been reported under both
    conditions.
  - Output "NA" for sensors whose slave addresses are not the BMC.
  - Output "Unknown" for sensors whose readings cannot be determined.
  - Output multiple sensor status messages on separate lines, rather
    than all on one line under verbose modes.
  - Output "Unrecognized State" if the sensor specifies a state that is
    unrecognized.
  - Busy sensors are now output with "Unknown" instead of causing
    errors.
  - When fields are not relevant, do not output as much information in
    verbose and very verbose mode.  For example, don't output
    hysteresis or threshold information for power supply sensors.
  - Alter some output ordering for consistency to IPMI spec.
  - Shorten/adjust some state strings for readability under
    non-verbose output.  For example, "Fully Redundant (formerly
    "Redundancy Regained")" is now just "Fully Redundant".
  - Change default privilege from user to operator.
o ipmimonitoring
  - Support -v verbose option to output sensors readings that aren't
    readable.
  - Check corner case for sensor readability.  May lead to slightly
    different output in ipmimonitoring.  For example, suppose a power
    supply sensor exists for a power supply that is not installed.  If
    the sensor is enabled on the motherboard, ipmimonitoring would
    normally report "Nominal".  If the sensor is disabled on the motherboard,
    ipmimonitoring would normally not output a sensor state (it would
    output "N/A" under verbose mode). Previously, "Nominal" would have
    been reported under both conditions.
  - Consider sensors without BMC slave addresses unreadable.  May
    result in sensors not being output like before.
  - Busy sensors may result in sensors not being output rather than
    causing errors.
  - Output "Unrecognized State" if the sensor specifies a state that is
    unrecognized.
  - Output multiple bitmask strings if multiple bits are set.
  - Output "OK", similarly to ipmi-sensors when no bitmask strings are
    returned from a sensor reading.
  - Shorten/adjust some state strings for readability.  For example,
    "Fully Redundant (formerly "Redundancy Regained")" is now just
    "Fully Redundant".
  - Change default privilege from user to operator.
o ipmipower
  - Removed many early experimental features from ipmipower so
    ipmipower is more like other tools.  Removed ipmi-version,
    cipher-suite-id, privilege-level, and authentication-type auto
    discovery. Removed ability to enable/disable a number of experimental
    features.
  - Changed --config to --config-file in ipmipower for consistency to
    other tools.  Backwards compatability maintiained.
  - Replace --ipmi-version option with --driver-type.  Backwards
    compatability maintained.
  - Removed hostname config file option.  Require users to always input
    atleast hostname.
  - Changed primary config file to /etc/freeipmi.conf.  Legacy config
    file searched for and still supported.
  - Prefixed config file options with 'ipmipower' for consistency to
    new global FreeIPMI config file.  Old options still supported.
o bmc-config
  - Support configuration of UserN:Lan_Session_Limit and
    UserN:Serial_Session_Limit (where N is a user id number).
  - By default, do not output unsupported authentication type enables
    when checking out the Lan_Conf_Auth section.  Output unsupported
    authentication type enables under verbose output.
  - By default, do not output serial configuration parameters on checkout.
    Output serial configuration under verbose output.
  - Remove checkout of "Misc" section and "Power_Restore_Policy"
    field, which is now handled by ipmi-chassis-config.  Backwards
    compatability commit and diff maintained.
  - Remove case sensitivity when checking a number of fields.
o ipmi-chassis
  - Alter ipmi-chassis output to print "unknown" when field is not known.
  - Alter some ipmi-chassis output text to be more consistent to IPMI
    spec.
  - Hide configuration options now supported in ipmi-chassis-config.
o ipmi-fru
  - Output FRU device names along with IDs in ipmi-fru.
  - Reduce excessive newline outputs in ipmi-fru.
  - Output more information by default.  Change the output of verbose
    vs. very verbose output.
o ipmi-sel
  - Change default privilege from user to operator.
  - Search of SDR records by sensor number and sensor owner id.
  - Support SEL Event Record debug dumping.
o ipmiconsole
  - Support --session-timeout and --retransmission-timeout options.
  - Removed -C short option for consistency to other tools.
  - Removed hostname config file option.  Require users to always input
    atleast hostname.
  - Changed primary config file to /etc/freeipmi.conf.  Legacy config
    file searched for and still supported.
  - Prefixed config file options with 'ipmiconsole' for consistency to
    new global FreeIPMI config file.  Old options still supported.
o bmc-watchdog
  - Remove legacy 'v' option for version.
